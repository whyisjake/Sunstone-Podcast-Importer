      "Title": "Role Of Dissent In The Christian Community",
      "Presenters": "John Dominic Crossan, D. Michael Quinn",
      "Description": "The tension between authority and personal conscience can be seen in the citizen's relation to political authority, the scholar's relation to academic authorities, and the believer's relation to the church. The relationship between authority and personal conscience is dialectic: the two are neither identical nor separable, and each is constantly informing the other. Dissent sometimes grows out of this tension. What examples do we have of dissent helping to build a religious community? What examples do we have of when it failed? How do we judge success or failure in these cases?",

      "Description": "The Church's history with adoption and foster care is gray area. Efforts like the Indian Placement Program and sometimes-coercive and secretive practices of LDS Social/Family Services were guided by wrong-headed ideas about the superiority of some familiesÑwhite families, wealthy families, temple-sealed familiesÑover others. Mormons who become foster parents are vulnerable to some of the same false ideas.

      "Presenters": "Robert A. Rees",
      "Description": "Jesus said, \"As a person thinks in her heart, so is she.\" Long thought to be just a metaphor, the idea of a thinking heart is now supported by scientific findings revealing that the heart has its own nervous system with an electrical field 60 times greater in amplitude than that of the brain. It generates 5,000 times more electromagnetic energy than the brain, and that sends more information to the brain than the brain sends to the heart. What are the implications of such understanding in terms of epistemology, spiritual inquiry, and revelation?",

      "Description": "My husband and I didn't just wake up one sunny morning and say, \"Let's join a polygamist cult.\" Over time, a convergence of psychological and social factors ripened us for the picking. Insecurities played a part. So did classic, cultish appeals. So did mainstream Mormonism, not just by laying a doctrinal foundation, but by training members to tolerate cognitive dissonance, and through its own, albeit far less extreme, cultish tendencies. This presentation will examine those factors through my experiences and the work of psychologists such as Frank Sulloway.",

It explores the way members with same-sex attraction have voluntarily removed themselves from the LDS community by assuming a diasporic identity, as well as how those members view themselves in regards to the Church and its doctrine. This paper argues that temporality is understood as being both static and fluid which allows church members, through ritualized acts, to move both backward and forward in time to moments of \"rupture\" and \"forever.\"",

Sawhill extols highly reliable LARCs (long-acting reversible contraceptives) as being pro-children, pro-life, pro-marriage, and pro-income-equality. Accordingly, why not have the federal government pay female participants enough to make implanted LARCs the norm? Despite its public interest virtures, religious leaders would probably voice opposition to such a policy, construing it as a \"license to fornicate.\" This paper presents a secondary cash incentive that would hopefully neutralize that opposition.",

Although they grant that the evidence for faith is incomplete, they also hold that knowledge of God is not attainable simply through empirical methods. Faith also plays a role in the Christian doctrine of salvation. How is the faith connected with knowledge related to the faith connected with works? Can faith be saved as an eternal principle vital to the pursuit of truth? Can faith save us for and in the kingdom of God?",

But a few stories have the power to launch us toward the divine by invoking sheer horror: psychological, emotional, and cognitive. Joseph Smith's polygamy is one of those storiesÑespecially for Mormons. But in order to ride this story, which will threaten at any second to buck us into a sand pit of denial or off the cliff of apostasy, we need to dismantle everything we think we know about how we can know anything.",

He believed that devastation, unlike anything Americans had ever experienced, would overtake the nation. It was a principal reason for dissociating himself from Sidney Rigdon and Brigham Young and starting his own church. The paper will explain why Bickerton decided to forsake Rigdon and Young, and will show how the Civil War grounded his belief in the Book of Mormon.",

Amygdala overdrive causes health problems (both physical and mental), which improve with spiritual practices that activate the wise prefrontal cortex, creating wellbeing and inhibiting fear and judgmentalism.

Nevertheless, studies of Millennials show a generation far more concerned with purpose-driven actions and a desire for meaning-filled lives than its predecessors. Can any organized religion appeal to a generation which increasingly identifies as \"spiritual but not religious\"? And, if so, what might Millennials stand to lose and to gain by participating?",

      "Description": "Mormonism often describes tribalism and communalism as having risen from our spirit instead of our body for the purpose of bringing us into Mormonism and closer to God. This paper argues that these traits actually evolved over time to help the individual view his or her tribe and benevolent activity in it as more desirable than individual selfishness.",

      "Presenters": "Gina Colvin, Joanna Brooks",
      "Description": "Notwithstanding its immense cross-cultural missionary workforce that spans the world, Mormonism still behaves like a white, conservative, American, patriarchal religion, dragging around American cultural trappings, expectations, and processes wherever it goes. Though much has been said about American imperialism, little has been said about American religious imperialism. This presentation makes a case for thinking about American religious imperialism and the pressing need to decolonize Mormonism.",

Does Jesus oppose lawsuits? If so, why does the LDS Church engage in litigation? Would Jesus encourage his church to structure its mission through numerous legal entities, and to operate with limited liability? What impact does LDS legal corporatism have on Mormon culture? This panel discusses research and analysis of all the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint's Utah incorporating documents.",

      "Description": "They fought for their children; like dragons did they fight. In 2013 a group of Mormon mothers with LGBT children organized a support group for themselves. One felt that the term \"Mama Bear\" did not come close to describing the ferocious love and fierce protection they felt for their children, so she named the group Mama Dragons. Since then the group has grown significantly and has been featured in a number of news stories, blogs, radio shows, and live interviews. This panel includes several of the Mama Dragons, sharing their individual stories about what inspires the fire they breathe for their children.",
