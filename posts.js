In new systems for public entrepreneurship, modern pioneers are blazing trails in today's Third World wilderness, suggesting paths others may take to act, to replicate, or otherwise move us toward a genuine Zion on earth. Differentiating between formal Church assignments and informal callings, many LDS advocates today are designing and developing strategies around the globe to empower “the least of these” among God's children. New, ethical visions are becoming linked with practical interventions to make a difference: laboring for justice, building a sense of community, bringing peace to the restless, feeding desperate mothers and their children, all helping to achieve personal redemption by engaging in sacred work among the poorest of the poor. I will examine key elements of social stewardship by LDS individuals, families, ward organizations, neighborhoods, and newly-established humanitarian institutions.",

Of course, it's not an arrival but a journey, a constant invitation to abide in the place of no fear. What does a mystic life demand? Likely Coleridge's “willing suspension of disbelief,” which is born in all children. A letting go to listen to the silence, to the spirit. With pioneers in my veins and my mother's “Pray at night, plan in the morning” in my growing up, I would add: Pay attention, maybe to what Plato calls “the divine madness of the poet.” Or more likely, to what is available to anyone as a believer, though having faith, opening the crown, and expecting. For anyone there await informings constant and reasonable, guides to living to the full measure of any day's potential.",

And it is the hard core truth about human experience and possibility that we find expressed in art and literature.

Americans and Mormons believe in freedom of speech but also in truth that prevails, in not suffering idiots or naysayers, and in saying something positive and faith-affirming or not saying anything at all. We believe there are things, in fact, that should not even be thought. It is not easy to endure someone who is enfranchised, as we are, to say what is right but who does not. This makes dialogue hard.",

In seeking a context for Joseph Smith's early visions, particularly the First Vision, I will explore the basic family triangle involving Joseph Smith Sr., Lucy Mack Smith, and Joseph Jr. Other members of the Smith family will also be studied, particularly Alvin, in their crucial set of relationships with all concerned. I use the modern concepts of natural family systems to examine the early life experiences and dreams and visions of the various parties, bringing to light new insights and new understandings of Mormonism's founding prophet.",

Court genealogists for Queen Elizabeth and Ivan the Terrible attempted to link, through genealogy, the entire history of the world from beginning to end, and early Mormon leaders claimed Joseph Smith was of the same seed as the British royal house. My research on medieval European genealogies suggests that Mormons are recapitulating a fascination with lineal descent and genealogical myths that is centuries old. I suggest some reasons why a mythical genealogical history was defended so vehemently in the waning years of the Middle Ages and perhaps why it is equally cherished at the end of the 20th century.",

Sex is, to the species, what food is to the individual: its continuation, the guarantor of its survival. And, as with food, a cult of the exotic surrounds sex: glamour is to sex what haute cuisine is to food. Pornography, though always available as a kind of literary junk food, has nosed its way into haute couture and popular culture as a chic frisson to glamorize the ordinary. As such, it constitutes a full-scale assault on intimacy, a marketing of the most spiritual of appetites, an invasion of wonder by advertising. Does the blatant commercialization of sex leave any room for wonder, for the “wonderful,” or will that word become, in regards to sex, as pejorative as “awful” now is in regards to worship?",

MORMONS' AND OTHER DISCOVERIES: AN UNSCIENTIFIC SURVEY, by Ardean Watts TEN REASONS SUNSTONE IS NOT A CULT. Of late, the symposium has been criticized for its cult-like influence. But Sunstone lacks the characteristics of a cult or charismatic group, often held suspect for exploiting members' resources and dominating their lives. For example: (1) Sunstone holds few meetings; charismatic groups meet often, sometimes even meeting to plan meetings. (2) Symposium participants express diverse beliefs while a cultist group resists questioning, let alone question-answer periods. (3) Sunstone does not monitor and punish sexuality, not even among the young. (4) Symposium participants do not endow Sunstone leaders with powers of inspiration and authority. 'OH BOY, MORMONS!” AND OTHER DISCOVERIES: AN UNSCIENTIFIC SURVEY. More than 200 attendees at the 1994 symposium took Ardean Watts's “Orthodoxy Test”, 36 statements on fundamental LDS beliefs. Respondents were invited to score yes, no, or in-between. The results have been ripening in a forgotten corner of my library for five years. During that time, the test's flaws became apparent and the results more surprising. The question “How do you describe your religious persuasion?” brought more than a hundred different answers including: “good for weddings and funerals” and “Oh, Boy! Mormon.” Attend this session if you are curious about the beliefs of the Sunstone community and for a light-minded look at the notion of orthodoxy.",

As the year 2000 approaches, many Christians are remembering and re-examining Christ's promise of his Second Coming. Joseph Smith and the early Mormons clearly saw the Church's mission as preparing for the Millennium, a thousand years of peace in which Christ will reign personally upon the earth. I address the question, “What is the exact nature of the mission of the restored Church in preparing for Christ's Second Coming?” My answer involves a re-interpretation of the meaning and scope of the Atonement. I argue that the Atonement is not yet complete and explain what still must be accomplished for its fulfillment, including an interpretation of the meaning and nature of Zion. THE ATONEMENT AND THE LAW OF MOSES. Most of the prophets whose words are recorded in our scriptures were working with people who lived under the Law of Moses, and they used it as one of their main tools for helping people to understand Christ. We Latter-day Saints like to think we transcend the law, but not having lived under it, we know only vaguely what we are transcending. Trying to understand Christ without the mediation of the law, we run the risk of not understanding him at all. I try to distinguish two ways of understanding Christ's atonement, one in terms of the Law of Moses and one not.",

There are (at least) two different varieties of this philosophy of difference, depending on which of its two nineteenth-century predecessors, Nietzsche or Kierkegaard, one favors, which I call “Dionysian” and “messianic” postmodernism. Most of the objections that are made against postmodernism have in mind the Dionysian version, but they fall wide of the mark of the messianic version. The line of objections raised against postmodernists, relativism, subjectivism, skepticism, anarchism, antinomianism, anti-institutionalism, nihilism, and despair, takes its lead from the highly Nietzscheanized face of the first version of postmodernism. But as regards the second or messianic version, it is false on its face and very likely betrays the critic's unfamiliarity with the religious and even biblical provenance of a good deal that is going on in deconstruction.",

      "Description": "THE IMPATIENCE OF JOB: DISSENT, STIFF-NECKED INTEGRITY, AND SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT Far from recommending long-suffering endurance and humble submission “to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon” us, the Book of Job argues forcefully for an uncompromising, even defiant, spiritual integrity, an authenticity willing to risk even enmity with God, or at least with the God of conventional religion. Only by owning our full selves, our fears, our resentments, our criticisms of God and his spokesmen, as well as our faith and our hope, can we move with Job past knowing God's name to seeing his face.",

      "Description": "A GENERIC SPIRITUAL CREATION A generic spiritual creation provides a solution to the conflict between predestination and free agency, yet it preserves the individual as the distinct entity that coexisted with God in the pre-mortal life. A generic spirit is not intended for any specific organism, but it can be placed in any one of many different life forms of approximately the same degree of complexity. Although God is the creator of generic spirits, geneticists may play an important role in controlling and designing the mortal bodies that house these spirits. The generic spirit model is also compatible with organic evolution as the mechanism by which God populated the earth.",

Society taxes and contributes to make possible our expensive higher educational system because it accepts that academic freedom, despite the discomfort, even anger, it often creates, serves the long-term best interests of society. Societies that have most supported free inquiry and expression have consistently produced the greatest art and literature and also the best long-term solutions to political and social problems. The freedom accorded what Walter Lippmann called the “indispensable opposition” of minority viewpoints consistently produces more truth--and in the long run, more peace--for society. I trace the fortunes of academic freedom in Utah higher education over the past forty years and argue that it is presently greatest, for both Mormons and non- Mormons, not at the University of Utah or BYU but at Utah Valley State College. I explore ways it could and should be expanded elsewhere.",

McKay became church president in 1951 he traveled to South Africa, the first church president to visit that country. While there, he made an important and impromptu change in the church policy regarding ordination of blacks. While not reversing that policy, he significantly changed the procedure for determining whether South Africans had lineage that disqualified them from priesthood ordination. Several years later, in the face of attempts by the church to establish a foothold in Nigeria, he and his counselors gave serious consideration to the possibility of reversing the exclusionary policy. The subject rose again in the context of the American Civil Rights Movement in the mid-and-late 1960's, and appeared headed for resolution in 1969, although this was due to misinterpretation of President McKay's intent. A flurry of activity by important General Authorities in the final months of President McKay's life served first to raise, then to dash the hopes of those who sought a reversal of the policy.",

Since the Book of Mormon clearly states that all sacrifices have their end with Jesus' “great and last” sacrifice, it is puzzling that Joseph Smith would have found such a restoration necessary. The answer to the puzzle lies in the millennial hopes and dreams of the early Mormons and in the restorationist theology of the Burned-over District. Clay's paper will explore that history, examine the eschatological theology behind it, and explain how it was supported in most instances by creative misinterpretation of scripture.",

Following the same path she took as a developing feminist theorist, Cecilia traces the stages in her response to BYU, from consciousness-raising to personal offense at individual oppressors to activism and vigorous (sometimes detached) critique of the systems of oppression. She concludes that frustration with systemic oppression is a powerful force for activists and theorists, one that can be harnessed to facilitate social change.",

      "Description": "Pianos & Drums: Taking The Gospel Global. What's Universal? What's Cultural? Lessons From Africa In her forthcoming book (fall 2000), Jan Shipps concludes that the last four decades of correlating and streamlining Church programs, materials, and procedures has resulted in the dislodging of Mormonism from its culture of origin and the transforming of it into a religion that can be applied in many different cultures around the world. Every would-be world religion confronts this challenge; darn few succeed. Pioneer stock Mormons who lament the loss of roadshows and bazaars would get little comfort from the Apostle Paul, who told Jewish Christians the Gentile converts did not have to keep the Jewish feast days and traditions. For him, the testimony of Jesus, becoming a new creation, and the unifying Lord's Supper were the universal demands. And yet, ironically, his epistles give specific, opinionated, instructions to the struggling convert congregations. This same dualism between implementing tested ways and allowing cultural diversity exists as the latter-day Zion spreads abroad. Mormonism's twenty-year engagement in Africa shows how our American-born religion must change to be preached and practiced in every tongue. As this panel reflects on their experiences as Church leaders in Africa, we can glimpse and marvel at the work of the Spirit as Mormonism changes Africans and as Africans change Mormonism. Just what is happening? What are the practical, logistical demands in establishing the Church? What long-held assumptions had to be jettisoned? Who joins? Who stays? What traditional Mormon (American?) ways work? Which don't? What can't be changed? How easy is it to separate the gospel from culture? What about spirituality from culture? Is having one world-wide Church program realistic, or will we eventually delegate and decentralize program development? Even in replacing one culture's arbitrary ways with another's, how much diversity even in cultural things can one Church bear? What challenges have we overcome, and what ones loom on horizon? What might a mature Mormon Church in Africa be like?",

      "Description": "Joseph Smith, The Smith Family, And The Coming Forth Of The Book Of Mormon: A Family Systems Approach The coming forth of the Book of Mormon is a story of epic proportions in religious history. Interestingly, behind the story of the visitation of angels, such as Moroni, and the miraculous coming forth of this divine book is an untold story of family struggle, sacrifice, and remarkable experiences. This paper will explore from a family systems approach the dynamic relationships in the Smith family that led to the coming forth of this divine scripture. There will be presented new historical material with new interpretations of this remarkable odyssey in Mormon history.",

Recruited in 1846 to aid the United States in its war with Mexico over claims to California, the Battalion has been called “the most unusual body of men ever to serve in America's armed forces.” Through primary documents, Will Bagley and David Bigler, in volume four of Arthur H. Clark Company's Kingdom in the West series, take a fresh look at the men, women, and events--many long forgotten--that tell what they say is the real story surrounding this important moment in western American and Mormon history.",

      "Description": "A Different (Yet Still Firm?) Foundation: Non-Relativistic Ethics Within A Finitistic Theology At this symposium twenty years ago, I took up the challenging question of the grounds of moral obligation in a universe that isn't ultimately founded in God's creative acts. In what sense can He command, and what makes anything right or wrong? A commentator complained that my point of view results in an “antinomian, relativistic ethic.” We were recently both quoted in Richard and Joan Ostling's Mormon America. A revisit is long overdue, both because this vital issue appropriately refuses to die, and because this fear of ethical relativism (combined with the great PR value of Mormonism's image as a bastion of morality) may be one of the enticements tempting many toward “the fleshpots of [modern Christian] orthodoxy.” I argue that, although fundamental LDS beliefs should, indeed, radically recast our understanding of moral law, they do not lead to relativism, properly understood. Indeed, they encourage the sort of personal moral experience that best promotes the kind of moral growth and development that are the purpose and design of our mortal existence.",

      "Description": "LDS 'Headquarters Culture' And The Rest Of Mormonism: Past And Present The Mormon doctrine of “Gathering” created a distinctive culture at the headquarters of the LDS church. During founder Joseph Smith's life, this “headquarters culture” had pronounced differences of theology, Church practice, and culture from the experience of Mormons who lived distant from the headquarters. This had profound consequences following Joseph's 1844 martyrdom. This paper examines the significance and changes of LDS headquarters culture in Smith's lifetime, in pioneer Utah Mormonism, and in 20th-century Mormonism. I also suggest possible directions for the headquarters culture in the 21st century. In addition to emphasizing the distant past, this presentation invites the audience to participate in walking down “Memory Lane” by sharing their own experiences with this dynamic.",

      "Description": "Is Evil Necessary?: Good, Evil, Sin, And The Nature Of Reality with additional paper on Eternal Spirits And The Necessity Of Contingency The prophet Lehi asserted that “it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.” The opposition between good and evil is often regarded as the fundamental opposition. But if evil were an essential part of reality, if it were necessary, would it not in some sense be good, because good would depend on it? If good and evil were inextricably connected, how could we distinguish between them? I will explore these questions and show that the belief that evil is a necessary part of reality has far-reaching and pernicious consequences. An alternate view of the nature of reality, which sees the feminine- masculine duality as the fundamental opposition in universal reality, will be presented. I will also distinguish sin from evil and argue that while sin is an inevitable part of existence, evil is not. 2nd Abstract- (Dr Huff) I use the work of contemporary philosopher Alvin Plantinga to draw support for the LDS belief that persons exist uncreate. Plantinga presents perhaps the most convincing explanation by a traditional Christian of how there can be evil in the creation of a perfectly good and perfectly powerful creator. However, Plantinga concedes there must be a contingent state of affairs that holds independent of God's will. I argue this concession entails a greater compromise to the classical notion of God's sovereignty than Plantinga admits.",

Last fall, nationally respected HarperSanFrancisco published Mormon America: The Power and the Promise by veteran Time religion writer Richard Ostling and journalist/editor Joan Ostling. After sketching Mormon history, with the balance and judgment of long-time Mormon watchers, the authors chronicle the major themes, practices, doctrines, and controversies, of the contemporary LDS--including polygamy, the move from separate kingdom into the American mainstream, the “power pyramid,” forever families and temple secrecy, missionaries, faithful history, Book of Mormon historiography, “Mormons, Inc.,” becoming Gods, dissent, BYU culture wars, and the prospects for the twenty- first century. Incredibly, there was no book that outlined the contours of contemporary Mormonism: Mormon America fills that vital and lucrative niche. Undoubtedly, it will be the primer for the 9,000 journalists who will attend the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and it may well be the standard, one-volume book on Mormonism for the next decade or two.

These very same techniques, accepted as authoritative in the court room, are applied by science to address the question of humans' nearest relatives in the animal kingdom. The DNA testifies of the continuity with nature and a close relationship between humans and African apes, with a common ancestor as recent as 5-7 mya. Corroborating evidence mounts as an ever- expanding fossil record documents an African origin of hominids and the evolutionary transition to the modern human physical tabernacle. Paper 2 - The Tree Of Life 2- Abstract How can the scientific data, which suggest that we descended from animals that lived and died on this planet for millions of years, be reconciled with the religious perspective that Adam and Eve, the first humans, were immortal? There are two distinct possibilities concerning the nature of their immortality. Either Adam and Eve were created inherently immortal or they were created as mortals and were made immortal by their circumstances within the Garden. If Adam and Eve were inherently immortal, what was the function of the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden?",

      "Description": "Mormonism On The Big Screen: What To Make Of Richard Dutcher's Motion Picture Success, God's Army? Utahans have flocked to see God's Army more than any other movie this year. Since opening in Salt Lake City in March, it has played, is now playing, and continues to open in major cities throughout the United States, and will soon be released internationally. What are people saying about a movie based on the exploits of an apartment of Mormon missionaries serving in Los Angeles? Does its success mean that there's a viable big-screen market for LDS films and LDS audiences? Is God's Army the breakthrough Saturday's Warrior for Mormon film, and can we now expect a flood of copycats? What lessons should be learned about telling Mormon stories to Mormons. And is Mormonism at the point where orthodox artists can tell their stories in ways that resonate within and beyond the LDS community? Come, hear what thoughtful critics and the filmmaker have to say.",

      "Description": "Calculated Risk: The quest for Freedom and Diversity in Utah Higher Education The freedom society provides us to teach and study unpopular ideas is a calculated risk. Society taxes and contributes to make possible our expensive higher educational system because it accepts that academic freedom, despite the discomfort, even anger, it often creates, serves the long-term best interests of society. Societies that have most supported free inquiry and expression have consistently produced the greatest art and literature and also the best long-term solutions to political and social problems. The freedom accorded what Walter Lippmann called the “indispensable opposition” of minority viewpoints consistently produces more truth--and in the long run, more peace--for society. I trace the fortunes of academic freedom in Utah higher education over the past forty years and argue that it is presently greatest, for both Mormons and non- Mormons, not at the University of Utah or BYU but at Utah Valley State College. I explore ways it could and should be expanded elsewhere.",

In the May 27 Church section of the Deseret News, the First Presidency stated that it “rarely takes a position on pending legislation and does so only when it involves an important moral issue.” Is there an implied Constitutional moral substance known to LDS leaders? Do these moral substances supersede the religious neutrality stated in the Constitution's First Amendment? Does law depend upon this moral substance to legitimize it? Does this imply a Mormon responsibility for the “rule of law?” Are there answers to these questions?",

This presentation will argue that these trends are a result of historical circumstances, in contrast to any fundamental reliance on doctrinal orthodoxy.

Was the Book of Mormon what Joseph Smith claimed it to be--an ancient sacred record whispering out of the ground to modern generations--or was it a product of what David Reynolds has called “the subversive imagination in the age of Emerson and Melville”? What would it have taken for Joseph Smith or one of his contemporaries to have written the Book of Mormon? What would it take for someone to write a book like the Book of Mormon today? As a literary and textual critic with a specialty in the American Renaissance, I postulate that six things would be necessary to produce a text that claimed to be of ancient origin--time, talent, knowledge, imagination, sophistication and an incredible amount of luck. I examine Joseph Smith's qualifications in each of these areas and consider whether it was possible for him to have produced the Book of Mormon out of his own imagination and experience.",

Matthew Hilton, a local lawyer and conservative activist, assisted the Citizens' group in compiling ten counts of misconduct against Weaver and petitioning the Utah Fourth District Court for summary judgment. Although the Citizens' document is in many ways reflective of national anti-gay prosecution, it also bears highly distinctive marks of Mormon cultural perceptions and anxieties. Hilton's imagery portrays a spectral lesbian sect in a striking inversion of the Mormon institution, complete with secret initiatory rites, a two-by-two missionary force, a female hierarchy of authority, and indications of polygamy. The Citizens' document is, among other things, an artifact of contemporary Mormon culture, an example of one culture's fears of its own projected likeness.",

Cannon, with President Wilford Woodruff's full approval, formulated a daring scheme to retain control of economic resources and business opportunities. This utilized deficit financing and bond sales in the east. Ultimately, much of the plan succeeded, but in the process, considerable resentment was generated towards Cannon. This caused him to enjoy less than cordial relationships with many other Church leaders in his last years after Woodruff's death.",

What will (or should) the next wave of Mormon studies bring? Are key stories untold? Angles unexplored? Segments of the culture ignored? What would the field look like if newer models of cultural history were applied to Mormon subjects? Have issues like race, class, and gender received their due from Mormon scholars? Are there little known, scintillating episodes waiting to be uncovered, the sort of material cultural historians find ripe for ethnographic or microhistorical approaches? Has Mormon history been adequately aware of its own place within larger American and global cultural movements? What might recent developments in literary and cultural theory contribute? What books would you write? (Secret and Sacred in the Nineteenth-Century Mormonism? The Construction of Gender in the Polygamist Household? Fear and Loathing in the Kingdom: Mormon Campaigns against Feminism and Gay Rights?)

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints then launched an effort to transport Mormon culture whole to distant members. This culture bloomed in the 1940s and 50s, gradually receding as church resources were concentrated outside the established stakes and the family was newly emphasized. This paper will be a fond memoir of the days when members trooped to the ward house almost daily for activities and fellowship, before the church retreated from the effort to fill all the needs of the members. The Church was then the place to learn elocution, part-singing, and the tango, a place of extravagant events. As the generations that provided that culture and benefitted from it move on, I want to appreciate those days when “The Glory of God is Intelligence” was interpreted in the widest possible way.",

      "Description": "David O. McKay and the 'Twin Sisters': Free Agency and Tolerance David O. McKay served as church president for nearly two decades and left a positive legacy that continues to enlighten church leaders and members to this day. He was a highly principled man, both in dealing with individuals and in administering the affairs of the church, and the bedrock of his principles was a firm commitment to free agency. The firmness of that commitment was shaped to a large extent by his personal exposure to and aversion to Communism, which he considered to be the antithesis of free agency. However, he realized that other forms of government as well as non-governmental groups and individuals were always at risk of abusing their powers and thus limiting the exercise of free agency among their constituency. A firm commitment to free agency demands an equivalent commitment to tolerance of divergent views and demands action. Using eight case studies, this paper will examine the remarkable extent to which President McKay respected both free agency and tolerance, thus endearing himself to Latter- day Saints across the philosophical spectrum, as well as to a large non-LDS community.",

I argue that spiritual gifts were initially available to lay members of the Mormon church in the 1830s under clerical supervision, and limits evolved during the Kirtland period regarding “appropriate” spiritual manifestations. Women exercised some of the same spiritual gifts as male priesthood holders in conjunction with their work in the Nauvoo Female Relief Society in the 1840s and beyond. I further argue that two factors contributed to the demise of women's spiritual gifts: the gradual clericalization of spiritual gifts and their absorption into priesthood function and the disbanding of the Relief Society in 1844 which had functioned as a nascent parallel to the male priesthood.",

And Southern Baptists have issued a formal apology for their racist practices. At the same time, other governments, institutions, and churches have refused to apologize for historic wrongs. Japan has yet to formally apologize for its reign of terror in China, the Australian government refuses to apologize for a century of oppression of its aboriginal peoples, and some churches feel that it is inappropriate to officially seek forgiveness. What responsibility do churches have for past wrongs committed by its leaders and members?

Do churches demonstrate weakness or strength when they apologize for historic injustices? Representatives of different faiths explore these dimensions.",

Catholics, Mormons, Protestants, Jews, African-Americans, Asian- Americans, Native American Indians, and Polynesians have supported “Defense of Marriage” acts (DOMA) in various states even though this is an echo of racist and religious bigotry in their own histories. Even so-called “liberals” in these groups have supported DOMA laws. The persecuted sometimes become the persecutors.

No bodies were found. Biological materials associated with both were recovered from a taxidermist's bandsaw Kleasen had access to. In 1975 Kleasen was sentenced to death for their murders but three years later won a reversal based on an illegal search. Kleasen remained in prison or on parole on other crimes until 1990 when he disappeared. Last fall at age 67, he turned up in Britain as a criminal defendant in new weapons charges with assured deportation back to the United States. The Travis County District Attorney in Austin has also reopened the case, and it is considering reprosecuting him for the murders. My paper will briefly present the story of the murders and subsequent legal action, Kleasen's life both before and after them, and what I have learned about him through the date of the Sunstone Symposium.",

My move to Sandy resulted in my being submerged into the sea of Mormania. To that time, my contact with “the Church” had been limited to a few open-door meetings with two neatly dressed young men with name badges on their dark suits. Over the years, I have come to learn a lot about the LDS Church, and many times the increased familiarity brought on more than a few chuckles. Between 1958 and 1995, I covered Eastern Europe as a journalist for the Dutch radio and television; from 1984 as a correspondent in Belgrade, the capital of former federal Yugoslavia. My career gave me an intimate knowledge of the communist machine, and upon moving to Utah, I was amazed by the striking similarities between the LDS and communist party rites and habits, in spite of their highly opposite philosophies. My paper will share a few of those similarities, centering on the use by both organizations of group control techniques and symbols.",

This personality would have been partly the result of his cultural (American Frontier) background, his family environment, and even his childhood typhoid illness and traumatic surgery. There have been few attempts to understand him psychologically, and virtually none from devout Mormonism, despite the challenge by Jan Shipps more than 20 years ago to solve “the prophet puzzle.” This paper will review four interesting ones, three from outside Mormonism, and one (partly) from within, by Whitsitt (1885), Riley (1902), Brink (1976) and Morain (1998).",

The conference's focus on issues like gun control and capital punishment, and the School of the Americas (taking liberal political positions on all three issues) is part of that shift. Also, the conference did not take legislative action on two big issues facing us: (1) accepting the baptisms of other denominations and (2) ordination of gays and lesbians; however there were positive signs at the conference on these two issues despite the legislative inaction on them. But there were also signs of continued authoritarianism.",

If persons other than God are viewed as literal children of God or “gods in embryo” they are also God in microcosm.

Over two decades, the novel has moved generations of Mormons and far- flung cultural fellow travelers to mordant laughter and scalding tears.

Saying that God is finite seems to be a very good starting point to solving the problem of evil, on the one hand. But, on the other hand, saying that God's power is limited seems to imply that God's plan might fail. Mormons seem to want to make assertions that imply that God is limited and yet they also want to claim that his power is absolutely sovereign. Just how much power does God have? Is he omnipotent in the traditional sense? Is he all-powerful in some more limited sense? Are we even in a position to judge the nature of God's power?

Synchronicity, as defined by Carl Jung, is 'meaningful coincidence,” a moment when outer events intersect with inner experience to create a new insight. Leonardo daVinci said much of his creativity came from the fact that he looked for the hidden meaning behind every event. Daily, for years, I have examined my life through the lens of synchronicity, looking for the hidden meaning. This focus has taken me on a remarkable journey of practical mysticism, the basis for a new book-in-progress. I will share many stories I now call “messages from the universe.”",

The use of the Internet in dispersing such thought and information holds some prominence here. This presentation will explore the possible impacts of the ready availability of uncorrelated historical research, of Sacrament Meeting talks from around the world, of pornography, or anti-Mormon literature, and of self-defining, and reinforcing communities of affinity and discussion. How are we, both as an institution and as individuals, using the Internet today, and how are our patterns evolving? The relevance and timeliness of this nexus has just been brought into sharp relief by the Church hierarchy's decision to “ask” all wards and stakes to shut down their web sites until further notice. I will propose the beginnings of an outline of research programs we could undertake in exploring this fast-evolving relationship, as church members and leaders respond to the new media and technology.",

Cynics often fail to believe in the sincerity of any position, and they doubt people are basically good. “Misanthropes” go one step further, distrusting people generally. and doubts that people are good. Both of these views harm us as individuals and they are antithetical to Mormonism. In this presentation, I offer thoughts on the nature of cynicism and how we might counter its negative effects when we find it in ourselves and others.",

Borg shares the results of his research on the historical Jesus. He examines the 'purity system” of the Jewish social world, and contrasts it with revolutionary “politics of compassion” that Jesus taught and practiced. The relevant question for Latter-day Saints is: to what degree (if at all) does adherence to a purity system (such as is taught and practiced within the Church) interfere with the “politics of compassion” and the open social vision that, Borg tells us, were the central concern of Jesus of Nazareth? This paper will explore that question, with perhaps a touch of levity but surely without light-mindedness, as it applies to the behavior and attitudes of the Mormon culture.",

Does “lost generation” apply to the contemporary “unsponsored sector” of Mormonism? Has a new generation appeared? Is one on the horizon? Have we skipped a generation?

The world watched the legal conflict that questioned the very essence of what constitutes wedlock and raised controversy relating to prosecutions, persecutions and the private place of plural marriage. The trial addressed charges of bigamy and criminal nonsupport, with the possibility of a future hearing to air a charge of child rape. The legal battle pitted Juab County attorney David Leavitt, the Utah governor's younger brother, against the gregarious Green and his five wives. Besides revealing the inner workings of a fascinating apostate LDS lifestyle, Green's trial again raises the issues of the legality and possible religious rights relating to polygamy and poses a fascinating duel between church and state.",

      "Description": "Exporting Utah's Theocracy Since 1975: Mormon Organizational Behavior and America's Culture Wars Contrary to most theocracies, Mormon Utah has always required democratic participation for its theocracy. Two major transitions bracketed the twentieth-century manifestation of Utah Mormon theocracy. Beginning in the 1890s, Utah's democratic theocracy had to confront significant political dissent from faithful Mormons and to accommodate non-Mormon political power. By the 1990s, the non-Mormon accommodation persisted, but internal dissent had become politically insignificant. Of greater interest was the process by which LDS headquarters after 1975 exported its democratic theocracy to the nation at large. This required politicizing the Mormon rank-and-file's adoration of the living prophet, claiming that decisions of the hierarchy are without error, appealing to basic fears within the national population, forging political alliances with formerly hostile religious groups, and organizing a permanent LDS network for political activism on national, state, regional, and local levels. The result is that LDS headquarters in Utah can determine the outcome of political votes in states which have less than one percent Mormon population. By any standard, this is an extraordinary development in American politics and society.

Many of us have direct, first-hand knowledge of the 'dark side” of hierarchical organizations - they tend to be rigid, controlling, and inflexible. Yet, a full understanding requires us to acknowledge that there are some things they do well. Indeed, some ask whether they should be changed at all. There are inevitable trade-offs faced by leaders when they strive to balance what are, in many ways, antithetical approaches for structuring their organizations. This presentation will discuss these trade-offs, along with how the organization's culture and environmental context affect the possibilities for change in any hierarchical structure.",

      "Description": "Delving into the Mysteries: Argument for an 'Arcana Doctrina' In a Priesthood, Relief Society, and Gospel Doctrine class one hears the often repeated but never supported injunction against 'delving into the mysteries.” Why is the belief in such a prohibition so prevalent in the Church when scripture encourages the study of the mysteries? What does the Greek word, mystery, actually mean? What did it mean to Paul who wrote and spoke in Greek? What did it mean to Joseph Smith and the other early presidents of the Church? What does it mean to modern presidents? Seventeenth-century biblical scholar, Jean Daill'e, coined the term arcana doctrina in reference to secret traditions, which Christ taught only to his Apostles because they were too sacred for the general membership of the primitive Christian church. Daill'e presented evidence that the Apostles later taught these secret traditions to a number of trusted presbyters who taught them in turn, during the post-Apostolic period, to such a select few that these traditions were eventually lost to Christianity. Does the LDS faith possess an arcana doctrina? If so, then where are they taught and who is teaching them? If not, then why does the LDS faith lack what was present in the primitive church as organized by Jesus Christ? I hope to answer these and other questions in my presentation.",

The price of traditional faith, she says, is your integrity. The story was, I feared at the time of its publication, an allegory representing my own career. However, the reception by the liberal Mormon community of that story and of my other writings and presentations of the early 1980's proved it to be otherwise. After decades of feeling spiritually alienated from my Christian heritage, I found myself feeling at one with it.

Golden Kimball's life in such a way that he had to deal with its financial impact for the rest of his life. The second section examines more general issues: the confrontation between the federal government and the Church that led to the 'Great Accommodation” by the latter, how a lack of access to the national money supply led to the creation of an elaborate medium of exchange within the Church in the form of promissory notes or tithing scrip, and the Church's uncertain survival in the depths of this financial crisis.

      "Description": "How Powerful is God?: Process and LDS Theology in Dialogue Process theology poses many provocative questions for LDS theologians about the nature and power of God, especially about whether God or some other force or power is the metaphysical Ultimate, how God exerts influence in a universe composed entirely of free agents, and what it means to exist in relationship with others. Is God the most powerful force in the world, or is it process, creativity, the moral law, love, or something else? Does the notion that God can only exercise persuasive power make for an adequate God? How are we and everything else in the universe, including God, interrelated? In these areas and others, process theology can stretch our Mormon imaginations. Do Mormon notions also pose challenges for the further development of process theology.",

      "Description": "How Big Is the Mormon Tent? Toward a New Understanding of What It Means To Be “Mormon” How Big Is the Mormon Tent? Toward a New Understanding of What It Means To Be “Mormon” What is in a name? . . .Apparently a lot! As recent interviews and official announcements have indicated, as the Church sets sail on its twenty-first century mission, it is signaling that it hopes to lead in determining who is and is not “Mormon” as well as which doctrines and practices from its past it will take into the future. This is a moment at the crossroads. As the Church grows into a truly global religion, the Mormon tent will need to broaden to accommodate members and spiritual styles from different cultures. At the same time, it is moving in a direction that seems to be more restrictive, that strives to project an image of uniformity, that takes pains to define and exclude heresy. This panel discussion will wrestle with these issues, especially focusing on possible ways to re-envision what it means to be “Mormon” that honor the Church's rich and varied past and present, as well as what would be appropriate for the future. Our panelists represent four ways people normally define themselves as Mormon: mainstream Mormon, liberal or cultural Mormon, fundamentalist Mormon, and excommunicated but believing Mormon. Each will first briefly explain their position and claims to be a legitimate member of the Mormon community. Then, through comments and interactions with Jan Shipps and Armand Mauss, participants will explore the possibilities of finding a fifth way: Can a new definition of what it means to be Mormon emerge? We welcome audience contributions! Moderator: Mark Thomas Panelists: Jan Shipps, Armand Mauss, Bill Call, Martin Tanner, Anne Wilde, and Levi Peterson. Time: Thursday, August 9, 2001, at 8:00 PM.",

It touches on many things, including faith, integrity ambition, sexuality, and community. Earnest at times, and slightly irreverent at others, it explores, reflects, and celebrates some of the interesting (and peculiar) aspects of Mormon culture. Synopsis: Full of anticipation, Elder Robert Wood packs for his mission. As the great, great grandson of Epaphroditus Wood, the greatest missionary in Church history, Elder Wood believes he, too, will be a powerful instrument in the Lord's hands to call sinners to repentance, work miracles, and convert many to the Truth. However, things do not go as expected, and as he nears the end of his mission, Elder Wood has not baptized a soul. His mission president gives him one last chance to redeem himself before going home. He charges Wood with turning Elder Diaz, an incoming missionary with a troubled past, into a strong member of the Church. Wood tries to inspire his new disciple; however, Diaz's free spirit gets both him and Wood into comical situations, and his probing mind soon has Wood questioning everything he had held sacred. Elder Wood's wrestling finally creates a missionary to make his great, great grandfather, Epaphroditus, proud.",

During this tumultuous time, Sunstone had to confront the impression that it somehow threatened the faith of the members of the LDS church. This included, on a personal level, charges from Church leaders against Elbert that he was guilty of apostasy for championing the intellectual openness Sunstone forums promote, as well as the push from some members of Sunstone's board of directors that he should step down.

I was one of them. However, when I began to dig beneath the surface of the blistering attacks in many of the 'FARMS' reviews, I discovered many fallacies, inconsistencies, and even outright dishonesty. Once enamored by 'FARMS' and their unofficial mission to defend the faith, I am now aware of their often unfair and brutal tactics, and I read the books for myself.

In particular, I have begun to note differences in attitudes towards sexuality in women who were raised LDS, yet taken to church by relatives and friends, in contrast to attitudes of those who had a more traditional Mormon upbringing. I have also found striking some remarks made by women about how much of the language used to describe sex and intimacy, especially when they were teenagers, has negatively affected their feelings about their own sexuality.",

Second, the internal consequences of the Manifesto which surfaced during President Smith's administration were undermining the faith of its members. The unmistakable vitality of the LDS Church today is in large part due to Joseph F. Smith's response to these crises and constitute a prophetic re-establishment of the restoration by him.",

Though expecting a massive influx of people, Church agents there were under-funded and overworked, with preparations beginning too late. The tremendous task of outfitting and providing handcarts for some two thousand Saints expecting to journey to Zion that season virtually overwhelmed them.

And the Book of Mormon instructs us to freely impart of our substance to the poor (Mosiah 4:16-21), even to the extent that they are economically equal with us (Jacob 2:17). Despite all this, Utah's majority LDS legislature maintains a tax code that is highly regressive, favoring big business and the rich over the poor. This paper takes a look at the political legacy that may have caused this economic policy, and at the viewpoints of LDS members and state legislators on the subject. It then makes a case for a critical look at Utah's political establishment regarding economic policy and the phenomenon among LDS voters to support that establishment.",

But the images are still as vivid as the lessons that continue to echo. Between September 1981 and May 1983, twenty-nine issues of the Press wrestled with conformity and dissent, scholarship and faith, answers and questions--engaging tensions in print as they played in people themselves. One hundred photographic slides capture moments recalling this unusual experiment in student publishing and Mormon studies. Snapshots reveal a skeleton crew of full-time volunteers, obsessed with a cause and surprised by what it enabled them to do. 'Some people thought the Seventh East Press was masterminded by anti-Mormons--but in my memory, we were just earnest, curious BYU students chasing the truth--about religion, life, and ourselves.”",

He has published numerous books, several of which, including 'The Rhetoric of Fiction” and “The Company We Keep: An Ethics of Fiction,” are standard reading in college English departments. He also happens to be a life-long Latter-day Saint, serving a mission (including a period when he was the companion to Elder Marion “Duff” Hanks), and attending Brigham Young University. This hour-long conversation will focus on key events in his life, often told in Wayne's own voice from that period (he has been an avid journal-keeper since the age of fourteen, and he is currently working on his autobiography). It will also focus on his primary identity as a teacher, (and we'll force him to discuss his impact on the wider scholarly world.) Finally, it will turn to his Mormon identity, especially his BYU years and youthful hope to liberalize Mormonism from within. Wayne has recently referred to himself as an “ill-defined Mormon.” Well, however self-defined, we define ourselves very fortunate every time we have the chance to have him with us.",

This session offers a historical and legal perspective on pertinent constitutional arguments, and tries to predict their future success with the Supreme Court. The (ironic) conclusion: Fundamentalist Mormons can expect constitutional protection when the court extends the line of Griswold v. Connecticut (legalizing birth control) and Roe v. Wade (legalizing abortion) to encompass homosexual relationships. No legal education will be presupposed, and I invite questions and participation from the audience.",

Death is often portrayed as a 'gateway” to the next life, a necessary step in the plan of eternal progression. However, this approach overlooks many profound life lessons we might learn and experience through giving serious contemplation and consideration to death, including our own mortality. In this paper, I contrast the ritualization of death in LDS culture with experiential reflection on death as developed by two thinkers, the Danish existentialist theologian Soren Kierkegaard and the contemporary philosopher Herbert Fingarette. I argue that we can come to understand a lesson of universal importance voiced by Kierkegaard, that learning to die well is the highest wisdom of life.",

Even though the First Amendment to the Constitution legally uncoupled the church and the civil government in the United States, a strong scholarly case has been made that a powerful de facto Protestant establishment remained in place for well over a century. This paper will show that the establishment pattern lingered on for generations, but will contend that it was particularly persistent in the nation's cities where establishments were not always Protestant. Showing that practically all of these virtual establishments withered away during the 20th century, the paper will argue that while its consequences are more visible in the culture than in economics and politics, a de facto establishment is alive and well in Salt Lake City.",

This parochial attitude is a betrayal of our liberal roots and an offense to our neighbors.

Among his duties, he recorded license plate numbers and provided lists of Church members under suspicion to the First Presidency and the Presiding Bishopric. Curtis also coordinated with the Salt Lake City police department. Somehow, Bishop Curtis's records eventually became a part of the Utah Attorney General's Polygamy Investigation Files.

      "Description": "Why Mormons Should Celebrate Holy Week The week between Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem and his triumphant resurrection from the dead is the most significant week in human history. Beginning with the early church, Christians celebrated the events of this week and for two millennia they have been the focus of annual celebrations of what has been called the Passion of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Beginning with Palm Sunday and moving through Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday, Christians throughout the world mark the last great events in Christ's life. All of these holy days lead us to the great drama of Easter Sunday when the angel rolled back the stone from the tomb and said to his disciples, 'He is not here, for he is risen.” Latter-day Saints celebrate the last of these holy days, but not the others, and yet there is no doctrinal reason why we cannot join with other Christians in offering our devotions throughout this week. His presentation offers an historical overview of Holy Week and presents the case that Latter-day Saints, especially with the Church's new emphasis on being the Church of Jesus Christ, should join with other Christians in making this an annual holy festival.",

      "Description": " Why we Need the Atonement: Repentance, Forgiveness, and Freedom from Sin, Death, and the Devil The doctrine of the Atonement is central in Christian theology. The atoning sacrifice of Christ makes it possible for us to be reconciled with God; without the Atonement all humanity would be lost and in bondage to sin, death, and the devil. The Atonement is necessary for salvation. Why is it necessary and why does it bring about salvation? Some theories of the Atonement raise difficulties that seem more problematic than the questions they are meant to answer. If God is merciful, why does he require a sacrifice for sin? Why can't he just forgive us? If Christ is punished for our sins, how does this satisfy justice? If Jesus' death is necessary, is it a good or a bad thing? Are the perpetrators of it sinners or do they fulfill God's will? Does the Atonement exalt suffering and in some way justify abuse? In this paper I will explore these questions, seeking an understanding of the Atonement that is grounded in God's love and shows how this love works to bring about freedom from sin, death, and oppressive powers.",

      "Description": "The Spirituality of Generation X It is always difficult to define what makes a 'generation.” The very term itself asks for a chronological answer; yet, when we discuss a generation, we are most often asking cultural questions. What characteristics do a group of people born within an approximate twenty-four year span share with each other? What events or societal trends have helped shape their experience? Do they have in common certain assumptions about life? The term “Generation X” has been applied to the post-boomer generation that most social scientists agree to as referring to those born from the early 1960s to early 1980s. Sometimes referred to derogatorily as a “generation adrift” or even a “slacker” generation because of what appears to some as an apathetic attitude (in comparison to the idealism of the young adults of the 1960s), it is nevertheless a generation with a deep spirituality that is simply different from that of their parents. There is much talk about the “graying” of the Sunstone crowd. It is therefore very important to listen to members of this younger generation tell of their own spiritual journeys.",

Two of these theories will receive special attention: the 'psychological theory” which argues that ordinances affect our state of mind so as to make us more likely to do what is right, and the “contract theory” which suggests that ordinances are primarily the beginning of a contract between ourselves and God.

      "Description": "Trailing Clouds of Glory and Lifting the Veil: A Pre-mortal/Past-life Primer The LDS church is one of the few Christian religions that teaches the doctrine of premortal learning experiences (D&C 138:56). Anecdotal evidence for pre-birth learning experiences is increasing in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. Remarkably, many of these learning experiences are reported to occur in connection with actual events and lives previously lived on this earth. Even the American Psychological Association has acknowledged the existence of 'past-life memory.” How does this phenomena present itself, how prevalent it is, and what are some theories for its existence? Can multiple earth experiences be reconciled with LDS doctrine? How are we benefited by considering our own pre-birth learning experiences?",

While it proved to be a financial failure, the 'Review,' in the words of Elbert Peck 'grandly stretched the boundaries of both the magazine and the foundation.” In its pages were feature articles on current events, people, the arts, book reviews, and the Mormon media image.

It was established to grow cotton, anchor the outskirts of Zion, and explore possible navigation of the Colorado River. It couldn't last. Living conditions were extremely difficult, including taming the Muddy. The cotton market collapsed after the Civil War. The Nevada border was shifted eastward (moving the mission out of Utah entirely). Nevada demanded that taxes be paid in gold, something impossible for settlers in a desert. After all of these setbacks, Brigham Young finally recommended these pioneers go elsewhere. Most of them went to Long Valley in southeastern Utah where they founded Orderville, the most successful of the United Orders.",

But it couldn't erase the Church's 300,000 debt and its toll on President Woodruff. He had collapsed during the dedication of the 4,000,000 Salt Lake Temple. Many members had quit paying tithing. So paying off old loans while needing money to promote home industry such as the sugar beet and electric power projects wasn't possible. Would Church efforts in the east to get more loans succeed?

The entire affair has been very upsetting to all parties, but it nevertheless raises important issues that should be addressed as Sunstone moves into the future. In this session, panel members will trace the history of the controversy, but, more importantly, they will try to clarify questions about what it means to say that Sunstone is striving to be an “open forum.” Does this mean that Sunstone should have an “open mike” where anyone can say anything? If so, what are the possible consequences to the organization as the sponsor of such a gathering? If not, what standards in terms of scholarship, topic, and tone are, or should be applied, when considering proposals for symposiums? How should these decisions be made and by whom? When does the exercise of “discretion” turn into an act of “censorship”?",

Any investigation of the other is only to show how it is wrong or it is whoreing after false gods. We can be an inclusivist claiming that all religions are really versions of our own, which is the true faith. Or we can be pluralists and claim that all religions are somehow true, that they are examples of a transcendent truth that is beyond the finite expression of any one faith, or perhaps that different religions may represent different truths. In this paper, I use the metaphor of marriage to indicate problems with each of these positions. I find Mormons that fit into all three.",

While I think there were a few effective moments, it became clear to me that I hadn't the chops to finish the project. I'm not Shakespeare or Sophocles or even Samuel Beckett. My focus in this session will be on my wrestlings with the three characters I'm most fascinated with: Joseph himself, of course, and the people who shaped him the most, his storytelling mother and his enigmatic father.

One is politics (secular); the other religious (the Church). Both rely on punishment to control, and both claim to supersede wisdom, truth, and justice. Both claim ultimate authority. What is the latest thinking about these two punitive institutions? A delegate at the 1787 Philadelphia Convention argued that a community needed one and only one supreme authority with the capacity to punish. Is there only one supreme authority for Latter-day Saints?",

      "Description": "Mormon Criminal Element in Nauvoo: The Multi-Faceted Tragedy of the Hodge Brothers There is a strong tendency to idealize “the Nauvoo period” of Mormon history. What is often overlooked is that Nauvoo was still a frontier town, prone to many of the same struggles facing all settlements of this period. One of these struggles was crime, and not all Nauvoo criminals were Gentiles. Using the brutal murders of a Mennonite minister and his son-in-law by two Mormon brothers, William and Stephen Hodge, as a springboard, this paper explores the issue of the Mormon criminal element in Nauvoo. In exploring the tragedy of these murders and the subsequent trial, hangings, and newspaper coverage of the Hodge saga, we gain a deeper understanding of frontier Nauvoo in the year immediately following the death of Joseph Smith. The story of crime in Nauvoo reaches into the struggle between Brigham Young and William Smith for control of the Church; it highlights the mindset in which every murder was seen as evidence of the plottings of “secret combinations”; and it raises questions about the role of Hosea Stout and the Nauvoo police in possible incidents of “blood atonement.”",

Thus, in their eyes, the conflict is 'Christ versus culture.” This paper argues that this question does indeed involve a conflict between “Christ and culture,” but asks if the defenders of tradition might have it backwards. Looking at the totality of Jesus Christ's teachings, might not one argue that homosexuals are accepted in God's sight on an equal basis with heterosexuals? Might not those passages in the Bible which treat homosexuality as evil be treated as the influence of ancient Israelite culture, in the same way many read cultural influences in the biblical writings which condone slavery and polygamy and assume a patriarchal social order which today we would all deplore as immoral?",

Husband/father as a universal role for men is woven into the fabric of the Proclamation on the Family. Drawing on Blankenhorn's research, I will explore this role. As set forth in the Proclamation on the Family, the husband/father role informs tradition, practice, and policy, including male-only priesthood ordination, the “forever family,” the Church's recent defense of the Boy Scouts of America in the lawsuit concerning gay scout leaders, and opposition to same-sex unions.",

In so doing, they become, by default, become some of the very few public faces of plural marriage, interviewing with countless reporters and publications.

This paper will also examine longer, more complex chiasms. Applying the criteria of a growing number of Bible scholars to the complex Book of Mormon chiasms proposed by John W. Welch and Donald W. Parry, I will demonstrate that the vase majority depart from what the chiasmists themselves call 'symmetrical parallelism.” Most exhibit imbalance, asymmetry, questionable demarcation, mixed parallel styles, and arbitrary omission and inclusion of key elements. Additionally, many proposed examples ignore and disrupt more dominant literary patterns and serve no discernable literary purpose. Even if we allow for the possibility that complex chiasmus might occasionally appear in the Book of Mormon, the multitude of near-misses points to what statisticians call the fallacy of the enumeration of favorable circumstances, or emphasizing the successes while disregarding the failures.",

Pragmatism honors individual temperaments while calling us to adventure and a robust engagement with life. Yet, it also contains strong correctives that are especially useful as we find ourselves occasionally spiraling off into universes of our own making or riding too enthusiastically on our own elegant but narrowly focused hobby-horses. If it were understood better and its criteria for judging truths were more explicitly applied, it could be demonstrated that we-individually and within our tradition-would greatly benefit from this international application of pragmatis.",

      "Description": "Musings on the Mind-Body Connection The Mormon teaching that our bodies are 'temples” and are sacred probably appears most often as part of the obligatory and frequent “chastity” discussions with teenagers. This doctrine, somewhat less frequently, may also be invoked in Word of Wisdom discussions. Finally, Primary lessons may note that coming to the earth to obtain a body is a major purpose of this life and necessary to progression. De we, as member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as Christians, or even as humans, do ourselves a disservice by limiting this discussion rather than exploring the connections between our bodies and our spiritual lives? This session considers physical, emotional, and spiritual connections, posits that better understanding of our own bodies can help spiritual growth, and throws out random thoughts and questions on what still remains much of a mystery to the author.",

Our church has truth, so why does it increasingly hide the truth? Can it be that as our church grows it becomes more and more afraid of the truth? Can it be that, as the Church encounters more and more diverse souls, it, in institutional reflex, turns tradition into doctrine and fable into dogma? Can it be that we are establishing 'infallibility” where there should be only searching? I spent twenty years as a professional sinner - Joseph spent only ten. So what's the problem?",

Dale The Boy Scouts of America revoked the adult membership of James Dale shortly after he identified himself in a newspaper interview as a gay activist. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that BSA's action violated New Jersey law. The question of whether BSA could exclude homosexuals from adult membership was resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court in BSA's favor. However, the Court's 5-4 decision raised more questions for Scouters than it answered. For example, can (or should) a celibate homosexual Mormon serve as a BSA volunteer? This session begins with a brief presentation of the Supreme Court decision, followed by a discussion of how it affects Scouting carried out by BSA's largest sponsor organization, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",

Opposition to gay rights initiatives is often based on religious belief that homosexuality is sinful. This is true for the Mormon Church that has been in the forefront of efforts to fight gay marriage and civil rights. Since this is a faith-based social policy, it could be enlightening to understand the scriptural basis of this strongly held Mormon stand against homosexuality. What are the teachings in the uniquely Mormon scriptures that support the position of the Church? This presentation will undertake a statistical analysis of Mormon scriptures to identify verses relating to homosexuality and a context analysis of these verses.",

The Role of Visual Image in Belief If immediate impressions of God the Father's countenance, hair color, age, race, voice, wardrobe, or dwelling place come to mind, chances are good that Michelangelo, Charlton Heston, or an Ensign illustration helped put those images into your head. History has proven that there is great power in religious images to clarify, teach, enlighten, comfort, confuse, mislead, and deeply offend. Such poser was especially present for early Christianity’s illiterate membership, but religious images clearly continue to impact even the very educated today. By focusing on popular portrayals, of the Father - from Renaissance masterpieces to 20th century cinema to LDS depictions of the The First Vision - this session will examine the evolution of traditional Christian and Mormon thought about who God is and how we fit into the picture.",

As part of the “get tough on crime” attitude common in the culture today, the majority of Americans favor the death penalty for the most serious crimes. I argue that capital punishment is both immoral and impractical, and it should be opposed on both religious and secular grounds by Christians, including those of us who also call ourselves Saints.",

Later inquiries were driven by historians who sought to discover the causal reasons for Mormonism's appearance on the American religious scene. This paper will approach the First Vision accounts as conversion stories, with variations seen as indicators of shifts within Smith's own worldview.",

      "Description": " The term “Generation X” has been applied to the group of young adults now entering their mid-twenties to early forties. Coming of age after the highly idealistic 1960s but in the midst of the information revolution and a tremendous boom in popculture, this generation has proven difficult t ounderstand, especially with regard to faith and religiosity. To many, they seem to be a “generation adrift,” constantly searching but never quite finding the kind of secure home within church and institutiona lsettings as did many of their parents. Does this mean “Gen Xers” are not religious? Do they“lack faith”? Or is the iconoclasm and irreverence of much of today's pop culture a manifestation of a different kind of faith, a different set of needs that perhaps require a new syncretic form of spirituality? What can faith traditions do to attract and develop strong ties with members of this generation?James W. Fowler will reflect on these and other matters related to Generation X from sociological and experiential perspectives, correlating them reflectively with his own work in faith development theory.",

      "Description": " In the modern movie lexicon, the term 'chick flick” has achieved a recent, rampant popularity. Aside from its inherent condescension, its primary difficulty is the implication that men and women are naturally and universally attracted to very different kinds of movies. Actually, the mass marketers of pop trash pictures have become the new Hollywood tastemakers by influencing manufacture of similar formula fare for both sexes, although separately targeted to male and female audiences. “Dick flicks,” meanwhile, represents the egregious double standard of screen nudity where the penis is virtually never visible yet wields a disproportionate ghostly influence. (In the genre archetype, the 1986 Reagan-era war propaganda film, Top Gun, America's patriotic flyboys get erections going into battle.) This paper will discuss modern films that smash stereotypes and increase our understanding of gender while expanding a sense of community between men and women, as in two remarkable personal documentaries, Kate Davis's Southern Comfort and Utahan Paul Larsen's Chasing a Good Day to Die. Among other films examined are What Women Want, Ocean's 11, The Sweetest Thing, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, The Importance of Being Earnest, My First Mister, I Am Sam, Kissing Jessica Stein, and The Son's Room.",

Told primarily through the eyes of Joseph Lyman Jessop, a polygamist sent to Short Creek to help build “a branch of the Kingdom of God,” this story explores behind-the-scenes reasons this “refuge” so quickly, within three months' time, became such a focal point for Church, state, and national scrutiny. Original Mormonism, a fundamentalist's Understanding of the truths of Mormonism After years of researching various Mormon belief systems, Stan Shepp has combined the truths of all of these teachings into a synthesis he calls “Original Mormonism.” His vision ties together doctrines of the pre-existence, agency, government, priesthood, authority, plural celestial marriage, sealing power, the kingdom of God, the plan of salvation (including Adam-God), and our own personal eternal progression.",

What turned up over the next five years proved astonishing: the lost “official” history of handcart veteran Josiah Rogerson; the letters of a forgotten Mormon hero, George Hicks; the narratives of adventurer James Gemmell and of John Hawley, “the Mormon Ulysses”; and “Discursive Remarks,” an account of the atrocity probably written by John D. Lee in 1859. While completing my study, I stumbled across a final piece of evidence that resolved all my remaining questions about what compelled decent men to commit a horrific crime.",

      "Description": " While traditional men’s organizations, such as clubs, corporations, the political process, law firms, and many churches, have given women full equality in our day, The Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints continues to bar women from many significant leadership offices both at local and centralized levels.Yet ample evidence from the Old Testament, New Testament, and Church history supports a strong connection between women and priesthood. I will argue that recognizing women’s priesthood is the single most important institutional challenge faced by the Church today.",

Beginning with God's intent in creation and elaborating on that intent in the Song of Solomon, adding in Jesus and some surprising advice from the Apostle Paul, this session reveals the bible's practical outline for a love that even the grave cannot destroy.",

The two main problems with this argument are (i) that it is possible that such experiences are illusory and (ii) that people of different religions often come to conflicting conclusions on the basis of their respective experiences. I will argue that religious experience is recollection, or, at least, epistemically similar to memory.",

Are the problems of an early return different for women than for men? What services and supports are in place for those who return early?",

The enigmatic sunstone of the Nauvoo Temple held, and might once again ascend to a position of prominence in the architecture of a new religion. But what of the moonstone? The sunstone and moonstone were linked together as pedestal and capital of one pilaster—making a balanced construction, one integral whole. What can we learn from these cosmological symbols?",

Since the Book of Mormon clearly states that all sacrifices have their end with Jesus' “great and last” sacrifice, is it puzzling that Joseph Smith would have found such a restoration necessary? This paper explores the history and theology behind Smith's thinking and ways it was supported by creative reinterpretations of scripture.",

She called for greater honesty, humility, courage, and compassion from both scholars and the Church. As measured by desired results, that paper was spectacularly unsuccessful. Firings at BYU, excommunications, disfellowshippings, a heightened level of fear, increased pressure on Sunstone, and the virtual demise of Mormon feminism followed. This paper will recall that initial 1992 presentation, analyze the environment for scholarship in the Church over the past decade, and indulge in some “what ifs.”",

How can orthodox Mormons respect the vision such people have? Given that many have friends and family members who are still devout, and that their past understandings were shaped by Mormonism, how much should people who don't believe Mormon theology be expected to divorce themselves from Mormon culture? Is it possible to leave the Church and still respect its members and its gifts to its members? This panel seeks to explore balanced answers to these questions.",

When applied to Mormonism, CS can deal with the cultural aspects of anti-Mormonism as well as internal aspects of Mormon culture. In this panel, Potter and Gordon will discuss what they have learned about teaching such a course at a state school.

Paulsen, which appeared inside. Still, of all the theological challenges that dominate philosophy of religion, “theodicy,” often called the “problem of evil,” seems in the minds of many Latter-day Saints to be less troubling than it is for more traditional theistic traditions. Why is this so? In this follow-up session to one presented at last year's symposium, panelists will examine LDS approaches to the problem of evil in conversation with the work of “process theologians,” thinkers who are working to apply the seminal insights of Alfred North Whitehead to religious questions and themes. What can Latter-day Saints learn from the work of process theologians? Can we develop our theological first principles to match the sophistication of their analyses and proposed solutions? Where might Mormon approaches to theodicy be stronger? Can the problem of evil ever be “solved”?",

      "Presenters": "Paul Tinker, Shane Legrande Whelan, Rhonda Whelan, David Zolman, Stanley B. Kimball, Rebecca Chandler",
      "Description": " A recent book, More Than One: A Sacred Heritage, A Promise for Tomorrow, by Shane Whelan, has initiated a new conversation among faithful Latter-day Saints about the practice of plural marriage. Most studies of Mormon polygamy have focused on its history and scope, have been sociological treatises about its contemporary practice among fundamentalist Mormons, or have been written from advocacy positions either praising or condemning its many forms. Whelan's book is different, for he writes from a confessional position as an active Latter-day Saint who believes that polygamy is a “true and pure principle that will once again be practiced among the Saints as part of the restoration of the fullness of the gospel and in preparation for the Savior's Second Coming.” Whelan adds caveats, of course: it should only be resumed when it is no longer against the law of the land and only when the Lord commands its reinstatement through the Church's recognized prophet. Is plural marriage as Whelan sees it? It is true that the Church has never condemned the principle, only its practice, but does that mean plural marriage is an eternal law? Will Latter-day Saints from this or future generations, like those in earlier times, be called upon to live “the Principle”? Is plural marriage a requirement for exaltation in the celestial kingdom, or was it a commandment only for nineteenth-century Saints? Are the doctrines and justifications given for the earlier practice of polygamy valid? Hear our panelists, and consider what you might say or do if Church members are once more encouraged to enter into the practice!",

I think this notion of two ultimates is a particularly fruitful one for theological interpretations of LDS doctrine, with its emphasis on freedom and persons. In this respect, it may be that the LDS notion of God bears a resemblance to Mahayana Buddhist understanding of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as human beings who have become perfect through their compassion for suffering creatures. I argue further that it may be more helpful for Latter-day Saint theologians and philosophers to look to other traditions for help in interpreting Mormon revelation than to look solely to the theistic tradition which has often been hostile to anything like LDS theism.",

These sources included ancient European heraldry, New England gravestone carving, Roman sculpture, and Freemasonry.

Over the past eight years I have interviewed all former Dialogue editors as part of my research for a four-part history of the journal. Using examples from various articles and the controversies they've addressed (and, at times, caused!), I will share my conclusions. Has Dialogue helped or hurt the Kingdom?",

If, as the D&C states, the day will come when Zion will be the only place one can flee for safety and the Latter-day Saints “the only people that shall not be at war,” perhaps we should begin thinking about how to create the conditions that would make this possible.",

Cora's case played a part in the Smoot hearings in Washington, furnished a battleground in Utah's newspaper wars, and divided a family. This paper puts a woman's face on the abstract issues of both land law and church discipline in an era when two clashing systems were working out an uneasy coexistence.",

I don't know what's wrong, and I can barely get through the days physically and psychologically.” So I simply stopped writing.

In the case of the parable of the Good Samaritan, I find many implications for issues such as race, finances, taxes, health insurance, temple, priesthood, orthodoxy, and love. Besides encouraging us to practice opportunistic and down- to-earth compassion, this parable subtly undercuts those who rely on narrowly viewed “orthodoxy” and offers a surprisingly stinging critique of those who focus on a spiritless experience with priesthood and the temple. I believe the parable calls us to radically redefine priesthood and temple worship as first and foremost centering on compassion. The session closes with an extended anti-Republican rant.",

The Catholic Church in my area recently ran newspaper ads inviting inactive Catholics to the priest’s home and stating, “any questions are welcome.” I have since collected much information about “Re-membering Catholics” courses and talked to several local LDS leaders about hosting something similar for inactive Mormons. So far, they have not been enthusiastic. I will present some of the Catholic materials and  responses I’ve received. How could these ideas be tweaked to fit this important need within Mormonism?",

How can we instill the values we cherish and even find a place for activity in organized religion—the “gathering church”—even when we disagree with much taught there? How might we more actively create in our families a “domestic  church” that can be fun and still help teach spirituality and essential moral values?",

Are Biblical and Book of Mormon images of a patriarchal seed transmitted from fathers to sons consistent with modern understandings of biogenetic procreation?

It is interesting to discover that he has had this gift since he was a teenager. Further, perhaps there is something for us to learn from Hugh's style of criticism: He has never been censured for his sometimes-biting words about the Mormon community. And although his influence has not been universally embraced by the Church, it has been deeply felt by many.",

Mormonism emerged in the nineteenth century primarily as a liberal religion. This tradition in Mormonism has been strong but has coexisted also with strong conservative elements. Recently, however, Mormonism has clearly become more identified with conservative religious elements that emphasize belief in an all-powerful God, distrust human nature, and value authority as the source of religious knowledge. As a Mormon raised in the liberal tradition, I chronicle this transformation through my personal experience and propose a religious stance and course of action that might resurrect and advance Mormonisms liberal religious tradition.",

For others, the call of Christianity---that we love our neighbors as ourselves and even learn to love (not kill) our enemies---takes center stage in their reasoning. Many of us also have a strong desire to believe our government is acting upon good information and sound moral principles and hope to answer the call of good citizenship  (however ambiguous that may be).

      "Description": " In 1999, the Michael C. Carlos Museum in Atlanta purchased a collection of Egyptian artifacts, including ten coffins and nine mummies, formerly owned by The Niagara Falls Museum and Daredevil Hall of Fame. Recent research confirms four of these mummies had apparently been purchased by the Niagara Falls Museum from the Wood's Museum in Chicago in 1878--seven years after the Chicago fire of 1871 supposedly destroyed the Wood's Museums entire Egyptian collection. It is well known that  the Wood's Museum owned two of the mummies formerly owned by Joseph Smith, as well as a portion of the Egyptian papyri associated with the Book of Abraham that was not part of the discovery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1967. So, are two of Smith's mummies now in the Carlos Museum? I'll examine the evidence. I'll also shed further light on certain ill-understood aspects of the 1878 eastern mission of Orson Pratt and Joseph F. Smith and their apparent attempt to purchase this portion of the  Egyptian papyri from the Wood's Museum.",

      "Description": " In storytelling, the divide between the good guys and bad guys is mostly crystal clear, but in real life, that demarcation fuzzes. Sometimes friends and family members—an apostate aunt, a gay sibling, an atheist co-worker—get labeled the “bad guys,” yet our own interactions with them tell a different tale. That leaves a lot of us feeling like there’s something wrong with our belief system or with those we care for. Palmer, whose book The Tabernacle Bar ricochets between the miraculous and the morally disturbing, describes a safe zone, a healthy balance between faith and doubt that she’s taken to calling “Benediction Alley.”",

Panelists include an anti-nuclear demonstrator who discusses the role of a strong military in preserving peace; a sixties-molded scholar who applies lessons from medieval history in support of the war; a recent British immigrant whose anti-war sentiments echo those of many European saints; a survivor of radiation-induced thyroid cancer who examines the morality of resuming nuclear testing; and a historian who outlines the ambivalence of LDS history and teachings on war and suggests how our theology, culture, and institutions might serve as resources for future peacebuilders.",

Interestingly, many of their topics are the very issues many Latter-day Saints still discuss with passion: the true church, apostasy, continuous revelation, closed vs. open scriptures, faith vs. works, free agency, what is a testimony, women and the priesthood, church discipline, obedience and dissent.",

      "Description": "The diaries of Helen Mar Whitney contain many prosaic days. But they also include moments of high drama, starting with the grueling, beautifully described death of Helen’s husband by dropsy in 1884.  When Charles Whitney, Helen’s teenage son, shot himself in 1886, Helen again recorded the event in detail in her journal, a harrowing few pages. Almost as traumatic to Helen was her daughter Gen’s marriage to a non-Mormon later that year. In both these events, Helen grappled with existential agony, then tried to make sense of the experience through her perception of the gospel.",

The plot consumed readers while its esoteric information piqued widespread curiosity and its religious themes struck a universal nerve—with the divine feminine, hidden in history, art, and culture, now emerging from obscurity. The book sparked a mass infatuation with Mary Magdalene and secret, heretical traditions—esoteric Christian, Gnostic, hermetic, pagan, templar, and Grail mysteries. The result is that a Medieval heresy has reached a 21st-century critical mass, creating a Magdalene zeitgeist. Yet how reliable are the book’s ideas?

      "Presenters": "Jared Christensen, D. Jeff Burton",
      "Description": " Last fall, I wrote an essay, published in Sunstone, that detailed my struggle for testimony. In it, I discuss how my desire for truth led me into the dark side of Church history, causing a battle between my  intellect and my spiritual ties to the Church. I also discuss how I’ve been affected by the dishonest dealings of some Church leaders concerning the Mark Hofmann bombings, which claimed the life of my father,  Steve Christensen. Despite the “costs” of writing that essay, the blessings that have come are far greater. In this session, I discuss the pros and cons of opening up to those around me, including my experience  with being made a scapegoat and used as a negative example to my missionary peers in the Ohio Columbus Mission.       Mormons are expected to gain a “testimony” of the unique religious tenets of the Church. This expectation is so prevalent that those not able to testify to having such “knowledge” inevitably feel marginalized, unworthy, and suspect in the eyes of believers. One peculiar response to this expectation has  been the creation of a group of Mormons I call “closet doubters,” active members of the Church who either pretend to “know,” or who remain silent and secretive about their plight. In this session, we will explore the reasons for this curiosity and the problems that confront closet doubters. I particularly invite those from faiths other than Mormonism to share their experiences. Does a similar phenomenon arise in other traditions?",

This presentation draws on my experience as the editor of his journals covering the period from 1880 to 1898. The journals tell us much about Roberts’ early life, but also illuminate his struggle with church officials over politics, his resistance to the Woodruff Manifesto, and his growth from young missionary to general authority. In short, they offer new clues into the life of one of Mormonism’s leading figures, and help us better understand his impact on the times in which he lived.",

Although some scholars have dismissed the tribes' ancestral claims, new DNA evidence has confirmed their descent from the house of Israel, including possession of the priestly Cohanim gene. What are the implications of these findings in relation to the Church's previous denial of the priesthood to blacks? This paper examines the evidence that blacks have held or were entitled to hold the priest-hood since before the time of Christ.",

      "Presenters": "Duane E. Jeffrey",
      "Description": " The story of Noah’s Flood has long been a matter of contention in discussions of science and religion. Though it has been discounted as baseless folklore by scientists and other scholars, recent years have seen a provocative case being made for a real event ca. 5600 Bc upon which the Noachian account may conceivably be based. This paper will briefly review the now voluminous data surrounding classical discussions of the Flood, the data involved in the new hypothesis of a massive but localized event centering on the Black Sea, and possible impacts of these new findings on traditional Mormon interpretations.",

      "Description": " We are non-Mormons who have observed that the LDS Church seems to be divided into essentially two camps, loyalists and dissidents, the blindly devoted and the brutally critical. Each seems to champion the Church's well-being. But if the Church's effectiveness in serving its members and the community declines, we think, ironically, it will because of these two groups, who are united in effect if not in method. We believe the LDS Church brings perspectives into social discourse that contribute to individual and community viability. We value LDS presence in our familial, social, and political lives. We would like to share with the Sunstone audience our positive observations about this LDS presence and open a conversation that might undermine the rampant objectifying of others that seems to be accepted in Utah as a matter of course. In so doing, we hope to stimulate thinking and identify positive ways Mormon and non-Mormon might relate constructively to one of Utah's most powerful authority structures, the LDS Church.",

His part tongue-in-cheek presentation, part in-your face lecture explores the inconsistency of celebrating the birth of Christ while at the same time presenting the antithesis to Christ in the guise of Santa Claus. Why would those interested in teaching about Christ begin their sacred relationship with their children by telling a lie that they later must unteach? Sunstone is pleased to have Gillespie present his (in)famous lecture to its audience. Come prepared to be entertained and challenged as Gillespie explores these and other issues about Santa, Christ, and parental trust.",

The plot consumed readers while its esoteric information piqued widespread curiosity and its religious themes struck a universal nerve, the divine feminine hidden in history, art, and culture emerging from obscurity. The book asserts that Leonardo Da Vinci encoded heretical messages in his paintings, particularly the idea that Mary Magdalene and Jesus were an intimate couple. This has sparked a mass fascination with Magdalene and with secret traditions such as esoteric Christian, Gnostic, hermetic, pagan, Templar, and Grail mysteries. The result is that a legendary medieval heresy has reached a 21st-century popular audience, creating a kind of Magdalene zeitgeist. Why is this book so compelling to so many people? Are the book's ideas reliable or valuable?",

One of Whitehead's stunning claims is that the category of the ultimate is made up of three notions. In traditional theology, one would expect only one notion, God. In process theology, the three ultimates are: the one, the many, and creativity. In this session, panelists will discuss the relevance of the process notion of creativity to LDS doctrines of intelligence and freedom. This discussion ultimately relates to how we think of the relationship between human beings and God and to the rejection of creation ex nihilo in both LDS doctrine and process theology.",

But the Book of Mormon also contains stories of dissenters who were clearly good guys, prophets such as Lehi and Abinadi. What does the Book of Mormon say about the nature of dissent and how it affects the community? Does dissent strengthen or weaken the Church? How should the community respond to dissension? How can we distinguish good dissension from bad dissension? I will explore possible Book of Mormon contributions to answering these questions and interpreting the meaning of its dichotomy of good guys and bad guys.",

How and when did psychotherapeutic methodologies take hold within Mormonism, giving rise to professional organizations such as the Association of Mormon Counselors and Psychotherapists (AMCAP) and BYU's Institute for Studies in Values and Human Behavior? Author Eric Swedin will discuss the rise to acceptance of LDS psychotherapy and the places it differs from mainstream psychotherapy, especially its rejection of “selfist” elements. How have LDS doctrines of family salvation, eternalism, and understanding of the “natural man” shaped the way LDS therapists counsel clients? How does LDS psychopathology differ from that of non-LDS persons? What roles have feminist dissent and LDS philosophies of sexuality played in defining the discipline?",

In much of the world, human beings have inherited a mythology that promotes men's authority and dominance over the earth and over women. This core belief has left a legacy in which women are subjugated and our planet is being destroyed. As we enter the 21st century, we are at a critical time where we must consider a new respect for the feminine. Our planet will not survive if the belief in power and domination continues. We must embrace a mythology that pro-motes and encourages a new awareness of unity, equality, and harmony.",

Chamberlin was a personalist philosopher who believed that the person was the ultimate category of reality. He studied at California and Harvard with George Holmes Howison and Josiah Royce, two of the most important American philosophers of the age. This paper focuses on Chamberlin's interpretations of Doctrine and Covenants 88, 93, and 130 to consider his idea of God as the community of persons with the Father and Mother at its head.",

If David O. McKay and Emma Rae Riggs McKay were models of “eternal sweethearts” and “romance in marriage,” the Hinckley marriage, as portrayed in the media, modeled an effective partnership of somewhat overlapping but largely separate spheres. Other sources to show the social representations of desired womanhood will be addresses by members of the First Presidency to the Young Women and Relief Society in their annual broadcasts and obituaries of Mormon women printed for a four-week period shortly after Sister Hinckley's funeral",

Best known is the ordination of women, which began 17 November 1985. But four other changes were part of the shift he orchestrated: construction of the temple in Independence, Missouri, during his tenure and its subsequent dedication to the pursuit of peace; the shift from closed to open communion; the appointment of a non-Smith as his successor; and finally, the idea of changing the church's name to the “Community of Christ.” What forces shaped this dynamic leader?",

Jesus.” This is Zed speaking, short for “Zedekiah,” one of three Nephite apostles who Christ promised could minister to the earth's inhabitants continuously until the second coming. In this monologue, we learn that after 2,000 years, Zed, the third of the American trinity, is restless. He had been sidetracked by the theater, where, unlike his own existence, people's stories actually have endings, and feels estranged from the other two Nephites who share his charge. Recounting the history of his early life as a translator of records in ancient Zarahemla, followed by his special calling, the neurotic Zed takes us on a provocative journey from the nineteenth-century American stage to the gold mines of the Sierra Nevada, from the dusty home of a polygamous wife in Utah Territory to the horrors of the 1911 Triangle Fire in New York City. Ultimately a meditation on immortality, Zed's “voice from the dust” humorously and poignantly addresses human frailty and the contingent nature of religious texts.",

Now many members are engaged in a crash course of trying to make sense of the new models and perspectives. And, understandably, some are struggling. “This isn't what I've been taught all these years!” “That doesn't seem to mesh with past prophetic utterances.” “Does this mean I'm not really a Lamanite descendent?” This is an important time in our tradition's history. Our understanding of and relationship to scripture is a crucial element in our faith journey.",

      "Presenters": "Doe Daughtrey, Laura Bush",
      "Description": " The academic study of Mormonism in the public university continues to generate interest, particularly among historians, scholars of religion, and many Latter-day Saints with academic training. This discussion focuses on the development and delivery of an “issues in Mormonism” course over a two semester period at Arizona State University. Using examples from classroom presentations, journal responses, and personal projects of the various LDS and non-LDS students in the course, we hope to illuminate some of the unique challenges of teaching Mormonism in a very large public university (especially one located in a secondary Mormon cultural region). Come find out how such a course can help both Mormons and non-Mormons develop tolerance for world-views different from their own, while also developing critical thinking skills that can serve them well inside their own religious communities.",

      "Presenters": "R. Dennis Potter, Bill Hansen",
      "Description": " The traditional theologies of sin and grace, Pelagianism, Arminianism, and Calvinism, all make one assumption about the nature of sin that I believe is incorrect. They assume that sin is primarily an action carried out by an individual and for which that individual is alone responsible. I argue that individual sin is the exception and that collective sin is the norm. My arguments are based on considerations dealing with the nature of individual and collective action, moral luck, and responsibility. This theology of collective sin also yields up a communitarian notion of grace in which each participant of the community of God is equal and interdependent with the others, including God. Moreover, this theology of sin and grace roundly condemns modern manifestations of political liberalism and prescribes a society that is radically egalitarian.",

      "Description": " In 1894, John H. Koyle claimed he had been visited by a heavenly being who told him there was a vast deposit of Nephite gold in a hill in Salem, Utah. The messenger said the gold in this hill was to provide relief to the Church and the U.S. government after a severe economic collapse. As Koyle's revelatory experiences and flair for prophecy became more dramatic, LDS authorities pressured Koyle and his followers to abandon the Relief Mine, as it was known. In 1913, at the Church's request, noted geologist/ Apostle James E. Talmage investigated the Relief Mine, ultimately declaring that no gold would ever be found there. For years, a battle ensued between supporters of Talmage and Koyle regarding the mine's efficacy. The 1913 First Presidency statement “A Warning Voice” was an outgrowth of this controversy, the document comprising a quasi-scriptural refutation of mining ventures and revelations coming from other than authorized sources. This paper will examine the history behind the conflict, accounts of Bishop Koyles' various prophecies, and some lesser-known writings from Talmage's journals.",

It was an interesting attempt to encompass the entire gospel plan, from pre-mortality to the afterlife. After that came a long dry period for LDS novels, with the form resurfacing in the 1940s and â€˜50s. But novels were few and far between until the â€˜70s, when Mormon love stories began to grow in popularity. Now Mormons are featured in hundreds of novels published by regional and national houses. Are our religion and culture accurately reflected in this burgeoning literary form?",

Calling on the work of Carl Jung and John Weir Perry, I will demonstrate how the Book of Mormon matches almost perfectly a ten-stage archetypal sequence uncovered through careful study of persons undergoing psychic stress but working their way toward resolution. Can this progression so integral to individual healing helpfully illuminate why the Book of Mormon has so successfully spoken to mil-lions of people all over the world?",

I think this is an important step if philosophers are to reach the coming generation who, as a whole, are quite comfortable with math- and logic-driven thinking. As a non-LDS theologian who has an interest in Mormon thought, I've noticed that most Mormons have been reluctant to make this shift away from the autobiographical. Imagine my pleasant surprise in discovering the writings of Blake T. Ostler. In this session, I will explore Ostler's argumentation and how I believe it bodes well for future Mormon contributions to philosophy and theology.",

Consequently, LDS apologists have brought their defenses online in order to counteract or minimize the critics' influence. Yet in the process of neutralizing such “attacks,” have the apologists inadvertently redefined the role and relevance of the prophets and, by extension, Mormonism itself? Does “Mormonism” as defined by the apologists and imbibed by faithful Web-surfing Mormons correspond to “Mormonism” as defined by the average member in the pews? What are the main points where “Internet Mormons” differ from “Chapel Mormons”? How are these differences playing out in LDS chapels, seminaries, and institutes today? How might things change even more as greater numbers of Latter-day Saints become aware of the criticisms and defenses (which often involve shifts in basic understandings or approaches to questions)?",

The predominately Catholic students brought a variety of perceptions of the LDS Church to the class, ranging from “cult” to full acceptance as part of the Christian tradition. Through an engagement with LDS primary sources and Douglas Davies's Introduction to Mormonism, as the course developed, the students developed a more nuanced understanding of the similarities and differences between the LDS and Catholic traditions, an understanding that framed the students' critique of John Krakauer's treatment of Latter-day Saints in his Under the Banner of Heaven",

A woman of Mediterranean descent just past twenty-six, Schwartz was an attendant at a contagious disease hospital. Swenson would soon cross the threshold of a fertile creative crescent in which many of her most evocative love poems would emerge, as well as a broad variety of other work that would appear in her first book, Another Animal in 1954. Later, the two would travel by Greyhound to Utah, where Pearl met May's Mormon family.

Kathleen Flake's recent book tries to explain why that was and what finally motivated the Church to abandon the practice between 1905 and 1910 in the context of the seating of Apostle Reed Smoot in the U.S. Senate. This session will explore ways of understanding these pivotal, turbulent, and dramatic changes, and why it matters.",

      "Description": " As president of an automobile company, governor of Michigan, stake president, and U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, George Romney demonstrated a rare form of integrity and commitment to the public weal. However, it was as a private citizen that Romney most exemplified the philosophy that voluntarism is not an act of charity but an act of citizenship. Romney believed that we each have a moral responsibility to be involved in organized volunteer activities to improve the well-being of the community, the nation, and the world. His efforts in founding many of the organizations that today facilitate the link between volunteers and those in need is legendary. Romney is credited as the driving force and inspiration for the 1997 Presidents' Summit for America's Future, which brought together all past U.S. presidents (held following Romney's death in 1995). This session will discuss Romney's philosophy and work in this important dimension of civil society.",

      "Presenters": "Van Hale",
      "Description": " Based upon the theory that all authors are unique in the frequency of their use of certain words, studies of word frequencies in the Book of Mormon have been conducted to draw conclusions regarding its authorship. A number of questions have been raised. Was Solomon Spalding the author, or Sidney Rigdon, or Joseph Smith, or was it the work of multiple authors? The authors of one article assert that the statistical odds that Joseph Smith, Spalding, or Rigdon wrote the Book of Mormon are less than one in one hundred billion. However, a string of significant uncertainties exists regarding every point germane to wordprint analyses in general that undermine the very merit of Book of Mormon wordprint studies. Is it likely that an ancient author's “wordprint” could survive the original Hebrew abridgment, then translation into an unknown hieroglyphic, and then translation by a yet unsettled process (word-for-word, thought-for-thought, or some other?) into a particular nineteenth-century, grammatically flawed, American English? Did Joseph Smith play a role in word choices, or was he simply a reader? Is the range of Joseph Smith's wordprint so narrow as to exclude him as the author of or contributor to the wording of the Book of Mormon? This paper will consider these questions and more.",

      "Description": " There is an elephant in the room whenever one ventures to discuss the state of LDS writing, namely: do LDS people actually read LDS literature? Or more to the point, do they buy it? In this presentation, I explore the notion that LDS writers may have to reach beyond the LDS audience in order to grab them. Curiously, LDS filmmakers seem to be crossing over better than do the fiction writers. Analyzing the filmmakers' work can give fiction writers insights on how to write Mormon fiction that non-Mormons can stomach, which might just get Mormon writers back onto Mormon bookshelves.",

Such is the case with the rise of Mormon intellectualism and the desire among some to have it be seen as a “community” rather than a “movement.” In this presentation, I argue that debates over such things are now pointless: those who would/do oppose intellectualism's influence on Mormonism already consider it a movement and have taken measures to reduce its influence. Using a model based on studies of political processes and social movements, I highlight similarities between Mormon intellectualism and other social movements. In so doing, I intend to describe more than prescribe, but those interested in transforming Mormon intellectualism in such a way that it might take less heat will likely find profitable ideas swirling throughout the presentation.",

But since 1878, RLDS delegates to General Conferences (now “World Conferences”) have carried the obligation of debating and voting whether a document presented to the conference by the prophet is a revelation and should be added to the Doctrine and Covenants. In periods of severe controversy within the church, such as during the 1920s “Supreme Directional Control” debates and the 1980s controversy over women's ordination, a significant minority of delegates have voted against the pro-posed revelation. The recent 2004 conference had some delegates reacting negatively to a revelation (now Section 162), from the first non-Smith president/prophet, which they thought was subtly supporting the acceptance of the ministry of homosexuals. This paper will explore the difficult challenge facing RLDS delegates as they attempt to decide if a document should become part of our canon of scripture.",

How does that balancing effort compare with analogous efforts by scholars in other American religious groups, especially evangelical Christians?

This expectation has been so prevalent that those not able to testify to having such “knowledge” typically feel marginalized, unworthy, and suspect in the eyes of believers. One peculiar response to this expectation has been the (unwitting) creation of a group of Mormons whom, twenty-plus years ago in Sunstone, I labeled “closet doubters”, active Church members who either pretend to “know,” or who remain silent and secretive about their not knowing. In this session, I will share my observations about how the environment for closet doubters has changed during the past two decades. Are the “testimony” expectations still as strong? How have they changed? Are there as many closet doubters now as there were then? Are conditions in the Church better now for their “coming out” to family, friends, and leaders?

Smith spends a lot of time in classrooms directly confronting the notion that blacks were and still are under a divine curse. His paper uses anecdotes about con-fronting religiously-based racist ideas, and explores, in particular, the resistance of LDS students to counter-hegemonic discourses.",

Thus language, history, and culture are the filters through which our understanding will be screened; they pro-vide the acquired perceptual frameworks through which we organize our spiritual experience. Much of humankind's effort to establish religious truth seems not only to ignore but also actually to deny our existential limitations. Therefore, some examination of these matters, including the epistemology of Holy Writ, seems justified.",

What difference is there in the problems facing the physically disabled and the mentally impaired? What are the theological implications of persons with disabilities? The moral implications? What programs and social services for persons with disabilities does the Church provide? What generalizations may be made about the attitude of Mormon folk toward persons with disabilities? What is being done to improve the lot of Latter-day Saints with disabilities? What more can be done?",

      "Description": " Abstract Mormonism seems to be in the midst of an identity crisis. For Church members, its founding claim to be the restoration of primitive Christianity along with its theology and worship practices have always made it feel very Christian. But with the Church's efforts to emphasize Mormonism's message of Christ even more strongly, subtitling the Book of Mormon, changing the Church logo, becoming more involved in coalitions with other traditions, supporting interreligious dialogue that emphasizes Mormon similarities with traditional Christianity rather than its differences, is Mormonism on a path toward becoming too “Christian,” too generic, just one more Christian flavor among many? While many applaud the new emphases, others are feeling as if too much is being lost, too many traditional LDS doctrines are being deemphasized and perhaps on their way to being abandoned altogether. Panelists' perspectives in this session differ widely on the Church's uncertain identity. How “Christian” should Mormonism be? It's an important discussion. Please join in!",

The soldiers work tirelessly to smuggle essential intelligence to the Allies, all the while forced to evade German troops.

This excellent presentation was very well received by the government officials, opening the door for subsequent communication and greater understanding. This session will include the same women who gave this PowerPoint presentation as well as a brief history and background of Centennial Park. Come meet these seven remarkable women.",

      "Presenters": "David Anderson",
      "Description": " In 1992, John Sorenson published his article “When Lehi's Party Arrived in the Land, Did They Find Others There?” Sorenson urges that they did, and that the Book of Mormon should be read as containing references to these “others” who had to have been present, but are not expressly mentioned. Indeed, Sorenson's “Others” hypothesis is now understood as a principal feature of the “Limited Tehuantepec Model” of the Book of Mormon. Under that model, the existence of these Necessary, Inferred Mayans (NIMs), is essential to the book's historicity because the early narrative events in the Land of Promise could not have occurred without them. So why are they so invisible, and voiceless? This paper critically assesses the “Others” hypothesis and identifies certain consequences it has for the Book of Mormon story.",

Brown stated that he was a Democrat because Democrats were more sensitive to the poor, he put his finger on an aspect of the gospel that many Mormons separate from their view of religion. Yet many scriptures show that compassion for the poor is central to the gospel. I contend that attitudes of Republicans and Democrats toward rich and poor help illuminate their attitudes toward many issues, such as civil rights, education, campaign finance reform, health insurance, foreign policy, the military, and the environment. It would behoove us to be sensitive to the poor as we vote in next November's elections.",

      "Presenters": "Ardis E. Parshall",
      "Description": " The Supreme Court's 1879 ruling on the constitutionality of anti-polygamy laws triggered an offensive in the campaign to crush Mormonism. Within days of the Court's ruling, the Secretary of State notified U.S. ambassadors to seek the help of foreign governments to “check the organization of [this] criminal enterprise” by halting the work of missionaries and cutting off the supply of “recruits” emigrating to Utah “with the intent of violating [U.S.] laws and committing crimes.” While sympathetic, newspapers and governments generally labeled the Secretary's request as impractical, and the matter faded from public discussion. Unnoticed by either the press or the Church, however, the Secretary's request remained the official policy of the U.S. government throughout the 1880s. Friendly nations were prodded to follow its guidelines, and less friendly nations could carry out repressive measures knowing there would be no U.S. government interference on behalf of its Mormon citizens abroad. This paper uses state department files, newspaper accounts, and LDS mission records to examine the U.S. government's methods in pursuing the eradication of polygamy within its borders.",

These characterizations have been made by embittered former members, politicians, muckraking journalists, and a writer of wilderness and mountain-climbing books. The only people with access to the community who have come to their defense have been their Salt Lake City attorneys. Since the January 2004 excommunication of Colorado City Mayor Dan Barlow and others in what appears to be a power struggle, no one inside the community has effectively presented his or her viewpoint. I am quite familiar with these communities, considering myself sympathetic with but not uncritical of their situation and recent events. I do not claim to have all the answers but will share a number of observations, strong impressions, and historical insights into what is happening.",

The paper then compares those findings with scholarly studies of pat-terns of doubt and resolution among Christians generally. As time allows, audience members will be invited to comment, from their own experiences and observations, on the accuracy or applicability of my personal findings and those separate findings by Christian scholars.",

In this paper, I argue that the global imaginaries, geographies, and mythologies of Christopher Columbus's “discovery” of the New World offer a more compelling model for our attempts to articulate the current debate on Book of Mormon historicity, in short, a “Colon-ializing Event.”",

      "Description": " This panel will be a roundtable exploration of important questions raised both by Dan Brown's book, The Da Vinci Code, and by its enthusiastic reception in the national and LDS markets. What makes the book so popular? The desire for the divine feminine? The possibility of Jesus being married? The connection between Mary Magdalene and the holy grail? The American citizenry's penchant for conspiracy theories? The hope of uncovering new knowledge about Christianity's origins? Panel members will examine the theological implications of the book, Dan Brown's use of historical and scholarly sources, and what all of these questions have to do with Mormonism's own cover-up of the divine feminine.",

He attempts to bring into focus several familiar, if murky issues, folk magic, treasure-digging, anti-masonry, and pious fraud, painting a detailed portrait of Joseph Smith as a sincere evangelical who used dubious means to promote faith. Of particular interest is Vogel's close reading of the Book of Mormon as reflecting Smith's biography and concerns. In this session, panelists will offer their reactions to Vogel's challenging and ambitious biography.",

This panel will discuss the health/nutrition status of LDS children in LDCs and the long-term effects of childhood malnutrition, the pragmatic and philosophical rationale for the present situation, and the potential for meaningful, cost-effective intervention from a Church and non-Church standpoint.",

      "Description": " The model of faith development presented by James W. Fowler in his classic study, The Stages of Faith: The Psychology of Human Development and the Quest for Meaning, has helped many people from a wide variety of religious traditions better understand their own faith journey. It has been embraced especially by many who feel they have “lost” their faith or recognize that they are in some way transitioning into new ways of under-standing God and the universe or are struggling with changing relationships with their tradition's sacred texts, teachings, and broader religious community. Panelists familiar with the work of Fowler and other stage theorists will discuss Mormon-specific applications of this approach to understanding faith, including the pros and cons of stage theory in general. In what ways is it helpful? Where does it fall short? How might its best insights be incorporated into LDS parlance to make Mormonism a more comfortable place for people at all stages of faith development?",

      "Description": " During his many years as one of Mormonism's and Utah's best-loved poets, essayists, and columnists, Clifton Jolley was unfailingly interesting. Blessed with piercing intelligence, a wry sense of humor, and a radar always tuned to finding life's wonderful ironies, Clifton has never been afraid to share what's on his mind. Earlier today (session 351), Clifton shared his “Mormon story,” in which he reflected on the foundational experiences and spiritual touchstones of his LDS youth and early adult-hood, on his family and the many Mormon friends who are still so dear, as well as on the events and longings which led to his new life, to his new marriage to Gail and his multi-faceted engagement with Judaism. In this session, Clifton will take us into his new home, into his deep longings for community, for soulful connection with others. He wonders, as do his wife, in-laws, and members of his synagogue, “Can a Mormon become a Jew?” It's a question he and they are still answering day by day, and if you know anything about Clifton, you know it's a matter that has his full attention, something to which he's applying all of his gifts. Embracing the best of his two spiritual homes, he's “becoming Jew-ish” while remaining delightful, insightful. He's a whirl-wind, and, as it was for ancient Israel, God's voice echoes throughout his gusty journey.",

These issues figured prominently in all three religious movements, but while all four leaders were New England born, except for a brief embrace, Smith differed from the others by rejecting the region's dominant attitudes on race issues, which were generally abolitionist and relatively progressive. What circumstances and forces led Smith to reject these “enlightened alternatives”?",

The first essay explores the context of the project. Why should we engage in such speculation as this? What is the LDS view of the role of reason in religious and spiritual life? How do we view the various attempts by others, including church leaders and prophets through the ages, to communicate this central message? The second essay focuses on the “concept” of the atonement. What is it that an explanation of the atonement is trying to explain? Before we try to understand just what Jesus did or how he did it, we need some conceptual clarity about the task he was undertaking, the problem he was solving.",

The literature of these two groups, while poles apart on most intellectual and social issues, exhibits characteristics of poor scholarship, including a preference for ideologically correct conclusions over sound evidence and reasoning, significant misunderstandings of mathematical and scientific principles, a reluctance to subject scholarship to rigorous outside review, and usage of gratuitous and often meaningless scientific jargon. In short, the creationist and postmodern science studies communities are hardly recommended as allies to LDS scholarship. The challenges to the Church from modern science must be  addressed head-on.",

      "Description": " In May 2002, the First Presidency of the Community of Christ appointed a twelve-member task force to give attention to the significant theological issues facing the church. The task force's first statement, “Scripture in the Community of Christ” was published in June 2003. It dealt generally with the issue of the use of scripture in the church without addressing the group's specific concerns regarding the denomination's continued use of the Inspired Version, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants. In the nearly two years that followed, the task force struggled to compose a statement on these issues, and in March 2005, the group agreed that it had reached an impasse and decided to move on to the task of formulating a denominational Christology. In this presentation, task force member Andrew Shelton will speak about the conclusions the task force has reached regarding Restoration scripture, and preview the group's coming work on Christology, which he hopes will eventually help the denomination better address the issue of scripture.",

      "Description": " With the publication in July 2004 of True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference, the Church has taken another step toward a unified body of authoritative doctrine. This concise 190-page document, organized alphabetically from A (Aaronic Priesthood) to Z (Zion) thus joins the missionary “white book” of behavioral rules, the newest revision of For the Strength of Youth (explanations of principles governing correct behavior), Bruce R. McConkie's Mormon Doctrine (very authoritarian but not “authorized”), and the procedures and policies in the Church Handbook of Instructions (not generally available to members). Although aimed specifically at “youth, young single adults, and new converts,” it for the first time makes available a source upon which members can draw with complete reliance that “this is what we believe.” This paper samples some entries from this under-advertised but significant work in the context of other behavioral handbooks now available. -- & -- The Proclamation on the Family is now 10 years old. It has been widely promulgated and heavily promoted in official church literature. Decorative copies adorn church building walls and the walls of devout Mormon family homes. This paper explores how the Family Proclamation is used in official Mormon discourse and how it is viewed by faithful Mormons. It also takes a brief look at official Mormon proclamations of the past and asks whether the Family Proclamation has a future as a permanent feature of Mormon belief.",

The discovery of the Nag Hammadi third-century Gnostic Library has awakened interest in this very early form of Christianity. My proposal is that if Joseph Smith restored true Christianity, then it should share many similarities with Gnosticism. Indeed, there are many strong parallels between these two theologies, starting with a shared sense that humans are saved by intimate knowledge of God and that the eternal unity of the sexes is necessary for “exaltation.” Further, this historical record shows us that churches run by the spirit will be brought under control by hierarchy. - - - - - - - - - - - - - When I was writing In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith, I had to decide which women could be safely documented as authentic wives of Joseph Smith. I eventually came up with a list of 33 women, but I added another list of “possible wives” (8 women) and another of “early posthumous marriages” (8 more women). So Joseph Smith, Jr. could have very easily married 40-50 women, rather than the conservative 33 I discuss in depth in my book. In this paper, I examine the evidence for Joseph Smith's marrying the eight “possible wives,” and give a brief overview of their lives.",

In Quiet Desperation adds to the dialogue the voices of a parent of a gay Latter-day Saint who committed suicide and a young Latter-day Saint man who has chosen to live a life of faithful celibacy. As with others who have contributed to the dialogue about what it means to be homosexual in the Mormon Church and what the responsibility of heterosexuals is toward their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters, the authors of this book give us much to think about.

Yet Emma Smith was charged with compiling “a selection of sacred hymns . . . which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church” (D&C 25:11). Eighteenth- and nineteenth- century musical forms and lyrics were dirge-like, focusing on man's evil nature and relief through death. This presentation traces Emma's legacy in creating a new, distinctive genre of sacred music that continues to dominate the LDS hymn tradition.

      "Description": " A large volume of poor Mormons moved into Missouri in 1838, and the resulting economic, social, and political tension terminated in a series of small skirmishes which occurred in August through October of 1838. This presentation examines in summary the Mormon raid and cleansing of non-Mormons from Daviess County, Missouri, and will examine in detail Crooked River, where the Mormon troops routed the state troops camped next to the small stream in Ray County, Missouri. The combination of these two attacks resulted in the expulsion of the Mormons from the state of Missouri.",

      "Presenters": "Karen Marguerite Moloney",
      "Description": " While DNA science challenges such Mormon beliefs as Israelite ancestry for Native Americans, it promises fresh pursuits for genealogists. Particularly suggestive is our ability, notably publicized by Cambridge geneticist Bryan Sykes's Seven Daughters of Eve, to track mitochondrial DNA mutations to seven European “clan mothers”, and beyond them, to African ancestresses. Traditionally overshadowed by surname-conferring bloodlines, our matrilineal pedigree remains a vital influence on identity. This essay examines how my own engagement with four hundred years and ten generations of Germanic foremothers connects me to my genetic past, and ten long-lived North Frisian women, in ways likely to elude a genealogist focused on baptizing deceased relations. “Feminist genealogy” pays tribute to the women, named on the bottom of our pedigree charts, who publish their history in our genes.",

      "Presenters": "Robert A. Rees, Michael J. Stevens",
      "Description": " One of the questions not satisfactorily answered by critics of the Book of Mormon who see the book as a product of Joseph Smith's mind and imagination and his nineteenth-century environs is how he could have found many of the elements in the Book of Mormon (e.g., a knowledge of olive horticulture, Egyptian names, ancient travel routes, knowledge of ancient American culture) in his information environment. If this material was a product of his mind, as some contend, then one has to explain how it got there. This paper takes a look at new scientific explorations into the possibility that one can access information outside one's information environment (both past and future), can receive communication across the liminal threshold between the physical and spiritual worlds, and can tap into “nonlocal” information and experience that may exist on the quantum level. This theory posits that Joseph Smith could have gained access to some realm of consciousness that could be characterized as both trans-spatial and trans-temporal.",

      "Description": " Caroline Crosby was one of the most detailed chroniclers of events related to the Mormons in California from the time of her passing through on her way to a mission in the Society Islands in 1850 until her family moved back to Utah at the end of 1857. For a year and a half, from January 21, 1854 to June 21, 1855, she resided in San Francisco. During that time, she probably recorded more detail about the branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which flourished there than did all other extant sources combined. This includes social interaction as well as the regular church meetings, and probably no Mormon visited there during her residence in the city without being noted in her diary. This paper draws from this most insightful document to convey a detailed picture of the branch and its people during that time.",

The paper then compares those findings with scholarly studies of patterns of doubt and resolution among Christians generally. As time allows, audience members will be invited to comment, from their own experiences and observations, on the accuracy or applicability of my personal findings and those separate findings by Christian scholars.",

What circumstances and forces led Smith to reject these “enlightened alternatives”?",

How do we view the various attempts by others, including church leaders and prophets through the ages, to communicate this central message? The second essay focuses on the “concept” of the atonement. What is it that an explanation of the atonement is trying to explain? Before we try to understand just what Jesus did or how he did it, we need some conceptual clarity about the task he was undertaking, the problem he was solving.",

The literature of these two groups, while poles apart on most intellectual and social issues, exhibits characteristics of poor scholarship, including a preference for ideologically correct conclusions over sound evidence and reasoning, significant misunderstandings of mathematical and scientific principles, a reluctance to subject scholarship to rigorous outside review, and usage of gratuitous and often meaningless scientific jargon. In short, the creationist and postmodern science studies communities are hardly recommended as allies to LDS scholarship. The challenges to the Church from modern science must be  addressed head-on.",

The task force's first statement, “Scripture in the Community of Christ” was published in June 2003. It dealt generally with the issue of the use of scripture in the church without addressing the group's specific concerns regarding the denomination's continued use of the Inspired Version, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants. In the nearly two years that followed, the task force struggled to compose a statement on these issues, and in March 2005, the group agreed that it had reached an impasse and decided to move on to the task of formulating a denominational Christology. In this presentation, task force member Andrew Shelton will speak about the conclusions the task force has reached regarding Restoration scripture, and preview the group's coming work on Christology, which he hopes will eventually help the denomination better address the issue of scripture.",

McConkie's Mormon Doctrine (very authoritarian but not “authorized”), and the procedures and policies in the Church Handbook of Instructions (not generally available to members). Although aimed specifically at “youth, young single adults, and new converts,” it for the first time makes available a source upon which members can draw with complete reliance that “this is what we believe.” This paper samples some entries from this under-advertised but significant work in the context of other behavioral handbooks now available. -- & -- The Proclamation on the Family is now 10 years old. It has been widely promulgated and heavily promoted in official church literature. Decorative copies adorn church building walls and the walls of devout Mormon family homes. This paper explores how the Family Proclamation is used in official Mormon discourse and how it is viewed by faithful Mormons. It also takes a brief look at official Mormon proclamations of the past and asks whether the Family Proclamation has a future as a permanent feature of Mormon belief.",

      "Description": " The discovery of the Nag Hamada third-century Gnostic Library has awakened interest in this very early form of Christianity. My proposal is that if Joseph Smith restored true Christianity, then it should share many similarities with Gnosticism. Indeed, there are many strong parallels between these two theologies, starting with a shared sense that humans are saved by intimate knowledge of God and that the eternal unity of the sexes is necessary for “exaltation.” Further, this historical record shows us that churches run by the spirit will be brought under control by hierarchy. - - - - - - - - - - - - - When I was writing In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith, I had to decide which women could be safely documented as authentic wives of Joseph Smith. I eventually came up with a list of 33 women, but I added another list of “possible wives” (8 women) and another of “early posthumous marriages” (8 more women). So Joseph Smith, Jr. could have very easily married 40-50 women, rather than the conservative 33 I discuss in depth in my book. In this paper, I examine the evidence for Joseph Smith's marrying the eight “possible wives,” and give a brief overview of their lives.",

As with others who have contributed to the dialogue about what it means to be homosexual in the Mormon Church and what the responsibility of heterosexuals is toward their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters, the authors of this book give us much to think about.

      "Presenters": "Richard Rands, Janet Brigham Rands",
      "Description": " At the time of the Restoration, there was no shortage of sacred music that could have been used as hymns by the newly formed LDS Church. Yet Emma Smith was charged with compiling “a selection of sacred hymns . . . which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church” (D&C 25:11). Eighteenth- and nineteenth- century musical forms and lyrics were dirge-like, focusing on man's evil nature and relief through death. This presentation traces Emma's legacy in creating a new, distinctive genre of sacred music that continues to dominate the LDS hymn tradition. Following this presentation, join in as we do a little “shape note singing,” an exuberant style of community singing and the original form in which many of our favorite hymns were sung.",

This presentation examines in summary the Mormon raid and cleansing of non-Mormons from Daviess County, Missouri, and will examine in detail Crooked River, where the Mormon troops routed the state troops camped next to the small stream in Ray County, Missouri. The combination of these two attacks resulted in the expulsion of the Mormons from the state of Missouri.",

      "Presenters": "Karen Marguerite Moloney",
      "Description": " While DNA science challenges such Mormon beliefs as Israelite ancestry for Native Americans, it promises fresh pursuits for genealogists. Particularly suggestive is our ability, notably publicized by Cambridge geneticist Bryan Sykes's Seven Daughters of Eve, to track mitochondrial DNA mutations to seven European “clan mothers”, and beyond them, to African ancestresses. Traditionally overshadowed by surname-conferring bloodlines, our matrilineal pedigree remains a vital influence on identity. This essay examines how my own engagement with four hundred years and ten generations of Germanic foremothers connects me to my genetic past, and ten long-lived North Frisian women, in ways likely to elude a genealogist focused on baptizing deceased relations. “Feminist genealogy” pays tribute to the women, named on the bottom of our pedigree charts, who publish their history in our genes.",

      "Presenters": "Robert A. Rees, Michael J. Stevens",
      "Description": " One of the questions not satisfactorily answered by critics of the Book of Mormon who see the book as a product of Joseph Smith's mind and imagination and his nineteenth-century environs is how he could have found many of the elements in the Book of Mormon (e.g., a knowledge of olive horticulture, Egyptian names, ancient travel routes, knowledge of ancient American culture) in his information environment. If this material was a product of his mind, as some contend, then one has to explain how it got there. This paper takes a look at new scientific explorations into the possibility that one can access information outside one's information environment (both past and future), can receive communication across the liminal threshold between the physical and spiritual worlds, and can tap into “nonlocal” information and experience that may exist on the quantum level. This theory posits that Joseph Smith could have gained access to some realm of consciousness that could be characterized as both trans-spatial and trans-temporal.",

      "Description": " Caroline Crosby was one of the most detailed chroniclers of events related to the Mormons in California from the time of her passing through on her way to a mission in the Society Islands in 1850 until her family moved back to Utah at the end of 1857. For a year and a half, from January 21, 1854 to June 21, 1855, she resided in San Francisco. During that time, she probably recorded more detail about the branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which flourished there than did all other extant sources combined. This includes social interaction as well as the regular church meetings, and probably no Mormon visited there during her residence in the city without being noted in her diary. This paper draws from this most insightful document to convey a detailed picture of the branch and its people during that time.",

The paper then compares those findings with scholarly studies of patterns of doubt and resolution among Christians generally.

      "Title": "Tracking The Sincere Believer: 'Authentic' Religion And The Enduring Legacy Of Joseph Smith, Jr.",
      "Presenters": "Laurie Maffly-Kipp, Jan Shipps",
      "Description": " Who was the real Joseph Smith, Jr.? Over the past two centuries, he has been portrayed as a great spiritual leader, a prophet, a religious charlatan, and a deeply unstable person. Was he a divine conduit or a mountebank? A caring leader or crafty seducer? Biographers and believers continuously have sought the “real” man beneath the sacred self-descriptions. In this lecture, Laurie Maffly-Kipp suggests that this quest tells us much more about ourselves and our own times than it does about Smith. For believers and nonbelievers, determining Joseph Smith's sincerity is a mighty business. For Mormons, Smith's honesty directly correlates to the honesty of the Latter-day Saint tradition. If Smith really met Moroni, then the basis of Mormonism is confirmed; to distrust Smith's sincerity is to distrust the entire faith system. Likewise, among nonbelievers, doubting Smith's veracity is a key component of their debunking. Regardless of their theological commitments, then, believers and nonbelievers share an obsession with sincerity. Did Joseph Smith mean what he said? Did he feel religious inside? These questions necessarily tempt a far more fundamental query: What is sincere about religion? Moreover, once we move beyond the sincerity polygraph, what remains of Mormonism, and of religious belief more generally? What will we see, about the Mormon faith, about religious sincerity, and about ourselves, if we begin to move beyond this obsession with authenticity?",

      "Description": " In the epilogue to the book David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism, co-author Greg Prince writes of President McKay: David O. McKay inherited a church that was provincial and backward looking. His immediate predecessors wore beards and came from polygamous families, two powerful symbols that were out of touch with modernism. . . . Clean-shaven, immaculately dressed, and movie-star handsome, McKay immediately caught the attention of member and non-member alike, and held it. He democratized Mormonism, . . . [adjusting] the relationship between church and member. . . . He emphasized the paramount importance of free agency and individual expression, for he understood that improvement of the parts would inevitably improve the whole. “Let them conform” was replaced by “Let them grow.” He willingly discarded institutional uniformity for the higher goal of individual excellence. He pitched a wide tent and then told members of all stripes that he welcomed them to join him and build the church within it. In this plenary presentation, Prince will focus on President McKay's leadership within the context of two forms of revelation. He will discuss the first form, “internal” revelatory processes, through the story of the various ways President McKay wrestled with the problems facing the Church because of its policy of withholding priesthood and temple blessings from black members. He will address the second form, “external” processes, in the context of the growth and development of the international church. What can we learn today as individuals and as a Church from President McKay's revelatory experiences?",

McKay's leadership and High B. Brown's liberal influence. Proceeding through a series of inspiring experiences and baffling incidents as a graduate student, young professor, and college dean in North Carolina, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Utah, he held many leadership positions in branches, wards, and stakes. Never church-broke,” however, he challenged the conservative status quo all along the way, enjoying a few notable successes but more often precipitating humorous results. He traces the evolution of his religiosity to his current way station, where he describes his spirituality as peacefully independent of the Mormon Church.",

If it can be shown from the Bible, should the doctrine become scripture? What could an acceptance of the plurality of Gods mean to Mormon doctrine?",

Ed's sense of our deep connection with all others has also led him to intense studies of Merton, Jung, and Gandhi, and also to an association and enduring friendship with the Dalai Lama.",

McKay’s leadership and High B. Brown’s liberal influence. Proceeding through a series of inspiring experiences and baffling incidents as a graduate student, young professor, and college dean in North Carolina, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Utah, he held many leadership positions in branches, wards, and stakes. Never “church-broke,” however, he challenged the conservative status quo all along the way, enjoying a few notable successes but more often precipitating humorous results. He traces the evolution of his religiosity to his current way station, where he describes his spirituality as peacefully independent of the Mormon Church.",

During the decade between 1972 and 1982, when ratification efforts had failed, the United Nations created a National Commission to organize a National Women's Year, a national convention for women, and state conventions to study the key issues impacting the lives of American women.

      "Presenters": "Greg Whitely",
      "Description": " New York Doll is a film that captures one of those rare occasions where life is not only stranger but also better than fiction. As the founding member of the visionary rock group The New York Dolls, Arthur “Killer” Kane belonged to a select group of musicians widely credited as the definitive proto-glam-punk ensemble. The Dolls pioneered a look and sound that paved the way for the punk and glam rock Dolls look-alikes who would follow in the next decade. Unfortunately, like many other bands, the Dolls crashed and burned amidst a flurry of drug and alcohol abuse. Fast forward thirty years, and find 55-year-old Arthur riding the bus to his job at the LDS Family History Center Library in Los Angeles. Arthur had converted to Mormonism in 1989 after answering an ad in Reader’s Digest. He’s somewhat content but still dreaming of reuniting with the Dolls and returning to life as a musician. Enter Greg Whiteley, a filmmaker and member of Arthur’s ward, who believes Arthur’s life story would make a wonderful short documentary and begins interviewing him. As they are moving ahead with this project, they learn that Morrissey, the legendary former lead singer of The Smiths and a huge fan of the Dolls, would like to have the band reunite for a huge music festival in London he is organizing. This breaking news, combined with the fact that Whiteley’s interviews with Arthur were beginning to “look like a film,” emboldens the filmmaker to envision his modest project more ambitiously. What had initially begun as a short profile of Arthur’s strange journey from rock god to lost soul to LDS Family History worker was becoming a bigger idea. The final film, New York Doll, is an 76-minute documentary that has excited audiences at festivals, including the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and in theatrical release. The film features interviews about the Dolls and Arthur with rock legends Morrissey, Bob Geldolf, Chrissie Hynde, Mick Jones, Iggy Pop, and others. It also features interviews with Arthur’s friends at the Family History Library (who pitch in to help Arthur get his guitars out of hock so he can begin practicing for the reunion) and depicts many poignant moments leading up to Arthur’s reunion with the other surviving members of the Dolls and their triumphant comeback at the 2004 Meltdown Festival.",

It was a time of great transitions for Hugh. He began his Claremont tenure with anti-Semitic attitudes (ironic given his own Jewish ancestry) but left with a deep respect for all things Jewish. He began at Claremont an eager academic; he left with a deep cynicism toward intellectual life. He began at Claremont with a deep love for Germany (having served his LDS mission to Germany only eight years earlier); after teaching with many Jewish-German emigres, he left with a distrust for Germany. Still Hugh Nibley's attitudes toward war, wealth, and the environment were present even then. And his devotion to the Mormon church was just as strong.",

How and where were these women exposed to these new beliefs and practices? How do they characterize their new identity? What impact have these spiritual-religious changes had on their families?

Its approach is unabashedly political in nature. Its purpose is to show how cultural representations in human life serve to reinforce power structures that marginalize some and centralize others. Once marginalized but now centralized in the American culture, Mormonism is a very interesting case study for this type of critique. I believe we can learn much about Mormonism's relationship to networks of American power through reflection on the ultra-positive representations of Mormons in pop culture. I will use as a case example the 'All about the Mormons' episode of the popular, animated comedy, South Park.",

His presentation will describe how he became interested in the field and some of the perils of discussing his chosen subject, formally and informally, with fellow outsiders and LDS Church members. These challenges, generally, the skepticism of outsiders and the faith-promoting interests of members, serve as a microcosm of some of the questions of method and audience which loom large for a non-Mormon just starting out in the field. The interpretive problems that beset the academic study of religion, issues of faith and scholarship, of the status of insiders and outsiders, of the parochialism that religion tends to bring out in scholars as much as in everyone else, are displayed in particularly stark relief with respect to the study of Mormonism, and are significant challenges to a student looking for a voice and audience within the evolving discipline.",

In attempting to answer these questions, I will also explore some aspects of contemporary film theory and ask what it means, in turn, for the pinnacle of Mormon religious expression to involve the watching of a film.

My new book, Victim of the Muses (see WWW.HUP.HARVARD.EDU/CATALOG/COMVIC.HTML), looks at the origins of poetics in western civilization in this perspective. The poet as prophet, Marsyas, Aesop, or Socrates, grotesquely ugly and a warrior with words, was often offensive to sophic society and became the pharmakos, or scapegoat, killed or cast out by political leaders.

      "Presenters": "Anne Wilde, Mary Batchelor, Richard Dutcher and Doe Daughtrey",
      "Description": " BIG LOVE, BIG ISSUES The new HBO series, Big Love, has created quite a stir among media watchers, cultural critics, and Mormons. Why the buzz? The show centers on the family of Bill Hendrickson, the owner of a growing chain of home improvement stores who owns three homes of his own, each occupied by one of his wives and their children. HBO is known for producing series that explore unusual families (The Sopranos, Six Feet Under) but suburban polygamy? The family's lifestyle is informed by Mormonism. In the second episode, it is revealed that at age fourteen, Bill, like other young men, was cast out of the fundamentalist Mormon polygamous community in which he was raised because senior leaders didn’t want competition for younger wives. And they practice religious devotions such as personal prayer, grace at meals, and spiritual blessings. But they are not portrayed as Mormons nor even as typical fundamentalists. They don't attend church nor wear temple garments, and only one family member, second wife Nikki (whose father is the prophet/leader of the community that ostracized Bill),dresses anything like what one usually associates with fundamentalist Mormon women. Still, the show is set in Utah with Mormon references popping up everywhere, a prayer in which Bill expresses gratitude for their being a family sealed for 'time and all eternity,' casual references to Relief Society, Young Women's, Mormon bishops, teen slang terms such as 'Morg' and 'Morbot' for super-devout LDS, the local high school's name and mascot: the 'Cumorah Cougars.' Given its uncomfortable history with its polygamist past and the great lengths the LDS Church has gone to in order to distinguish today's Mormonism from its nineteenth-century incarnation, LDS leaders are quite uncomfortable with the series, urging producers to place disclaimers in the credits and issuing statements to the press and local Mormon leaders clarifying the current LDS stance toward the practice of polygamy. In contrast, however, some Latter-day Saints are quietly pleased that Big Love has come along because it is forcing a fresh discussion of polygamy and the difficult balancing act Church leaders have tried to perform this past century of renouncing the practice while never denouncing the doctrine of plural marriage. In this session, we're pleased to have the opportunity to talk about the series and the issues it raises. How many families like the Hendricksons live in the United States today? How accurate are the series' portrayals of the joys and trials of plural families? What might the fallout, both positive and negative, be for the LDS Church should the series become a hit and genuine player in America's culture wars?",

The most important set of LDS interests is represented by 'faithful scholarship,' which has come to set the standard of acceptable scholarship about Mormonism for many Latter-day Saints poised to help shape the emerging subfield as scholars, students, donors, and local community constituents. How did faithful scholarship become the dominant normative model for LDS scholars, replacing relatively more anti-intellectual and more naturalistic outlooks in the process? What does the influence of faithful scholarship mean for the future of Mormon studies, at Claremont and elsewhere?",

      "Description": " THE KINGDOM OF GOD OR NOTHING: JACOB TAUBES, JOSEPH SMITH, AND MORMON POLITICAL THEOLOGY Does Mormon political theology endorse positive political action in the world or theological withdrawal from worldly political authority as a political attitude? While many political theologies are often either positive or negative toward involvement, LDS doctrine seems to have characteristics of both. In this paper, I compare Joseph Smith's teachings with Jacob Taubes's “radical” reading of St. Paul. Taubes, a Jewish philosopher, argues that Paul's Epistle to the Romans expresses a negative political theology. Building on Richard Lloyd Anderson's argument that Paul and Smith have much in common, I use Taubes's perspectives as a tool for identifying aspects of negative political theology in LDS teachings which, despite appearances to the contrary, seem to underlie and, in a sense, override the better-known and more frequently quoted aspects of positive political theology.",

Now I teach religious studies' students at Utah Valley State College, and I find that many of these students who share the passion I had for religious studies are the very ones who are leaving the Church. In this session, I will share some of their feelings (gathered through personal interviews) and contrast them with my own personal faith journey. Kimball- Boyd Petersen and I became friends sixteen years ago when we both lived near Washington D.C. I was experiencing a crisis of faith, and Boyd served as a much-needed sounding board. Through the ensuing years, Boyd's presence in my life provided a bandage for my wounded and bleeding faith, allowing me to feel connected to the Church even while doubting. Still, not until I was introduced to James Fowler's Stages of Faith some seven years later did I feel permission to fully expose my wounds, to truly face the loss of my faith altogether, so they could actually heal. Fowler's work and my mentoring friend gave me the tools I needed to find a meaningful place within my tradition.",

More than twenty films have emerged since then, some produced to have crossover appeal (e.g., On the Other Side of Heaven and Dutcher's films, including his newest, States of Grace), others unabashedly insular, relying on Mormon in-humor and banking on LDS religiosity (e.g., The Singles Ward, The R.M., Day of Defense). Where do things stand at Mormon Cinema's five-year mark? Now that the novelty that created initial interest in these films has worn off and audiences have endured quite a few bad films, is the fledgling genre dying? What can be done to ensure its survival and lay the groundwork for future flourishing?",

      "Description": " William Lobdell’s 16 February 2006 Los Angeles Times story is the latest in a string of stories over the past four years in which journalists have focused public attention on how DNA research on Amerindian ancestry has impacted discussions of Book of Mormon historicity. Until now, the impact of these stories on typical Mormon discourse has been minimal. Perhaps it was the front-page placement of Lobdell’s story, perhaps it was the tug of the human stories it told of Native American and Polynesian Latter-day Saints who had once thought they were Lamanites and now are not so sure, or perhaps it is simply that multiple exposures to the issue are now having a cumulative effect, but it seems that this latest story has begun to reach the ears of and unsettle more Latter-day Saints than ever before. (One evidence for this is the Church’s adding links on its official website, www.lds.org, to seven additional and often more aggressive and speculative responses to the DNA studies than the four it has had links to for the past several years.) In this session, we welcome William Lobdell who will share with us the story of how he came to write this article as well as about his experiences in its wake. We are also excited to hear from other panelists who will help catch us up on the science of DNA and the recent findings that are generating the discussion and how they are being employed by both critics and apologists, provide an overview of the history and politics of “Lamanite identity,” and present fresh perspectives on the relationship between science and human meaning-making. Where does the discussion of Book of Mormon historicity currently stand? Is a major paradigm shift for understanding this foundation scripture on the immediate horizon? If so, what might it look like?",

In the course of his presentation, Phil and attendees examine Mormon cultural “mantras,” the repetitive phrases and ideas that help organize the internal lives of many Latter-day Saints.

A common feature of academic scholarship written on Mormonism has been to highlight its unique theology in which God the Father not only possesses a physical body but we, as his children, have the potential to progress and become as he is: Gods and Goddesses. Some of these scholars have used this as an opportunity to classify Mormonism as being a polytheistic religion. Not only does such a classification misrepresent Mormonism, its worship practices and beliefs, the polytheistic label also dislocates the religion from its socio-historical context and presents it as a religion more akin to paganism than Christianity.",

This presentation seeks to step into this void by exploring how Angels, considered by many to be a canonically queer text, constructs the feminine by engaging revelation as both an agent of feminine pathologization and a vehicle for creating gendered transformations that matter.",

Informed by themes and questions in contemporary debates about colonialism, conversion, and globalized religion, panelists will explore Mormon growth and attitudes toward religious and cultural “others.” Can intercultural activities ever be fair or balanced? Is missionary work or even interreligious dialogue a cloak for cultural genocide?",

Isn't that somewhat literalistic and naive? How can something as large as Divinity be limited to something so grossly earthy as a body with genitals?” This presentation explores the ramifications of these questions: Why is an embodied God usually seen as inferior to a God beyond categories? And why has the transcendent God usually been pictured as male? Is it necessary to redeem the idea of embodiment to redeem women?",

The journals tells us much about Roberts' early life, his growth from young missionary to general authority, but also illuminates his struggle with Church officials over politics and his resistance to the Woodruff Manifesto which ended the practice of polygamy. In short, they offer new clues into the life of one of Mormonism's leading thinkers and help us better understand his impact on the times in which he lived.",

More than twenty films have been released since then, some produced to have crossover appeal (e.g., On the Other Side of Heaven and Dutcher's films, including his newest, States of Grace), others unabashedly insular, relying on Mormon in-humor and banking on LDS religiosity (e.g., The Singles Ward, The R.M., Day of Defense). Where do things stand at Mormon Cinema's five-year mark? Now that the novelty that created initial interest in these films has worn off and audiences have endured quite a few bad films, is the fledgling genre dying?

      "Description": " Religion and Pop Culture: Shotgun Wedding, Marriage of Convenience, or Match Made in Heaven? We've come a long way since Hollywood's idea of religion was confined to biblical sand-and-sword operas; Irish priests and chaplains with twinkly eyes; and morally corrupt Protestant evangelists like Elmer Gantry. Barely a month passes without a movie or television show that portrays people of faith, often in a favorable light. By the same token, Christian creators of alternative culture have come a long way from showing Billy Graham studio movies in church basements; producing feel-good, uplifting television dramas for the Sunday morning broadcast ghetto; or publishing treacly books that sell only because they are “Christian.” Popular culture has experienced a seismic shift in the past two decades, thanks in part to the global market economy. Commercial producers now recognize that evangelical Christians constitute a lucrative, discrete market that will respond if the product appeals to them. And sophisticated evangelicals have learned that if their production values are equal to the marketplace, their movies, TV shows, music, books, radio stations, and stand-up comics can enable them to protect their constituency from the toxic popular culture. As an unintended consequence, the best of their creations can provide effective outreach for the unchurched. Join celebrated religion writer and astute media observer Mark Pinsky for a fascinating tour through this shifting terrain as he explores what lies ahead. Is this just a blip, or is there a fundamental change in American popular culture, one that integrates faith and religion as part of the landscape? Will ensemble television comedies and dramas now have “the Christian” as a stock character, the way many now have “the gay character”? If Christian movie producers like Walden, or commercial studios, produce a string of high-budget bombs at the box office, will this trend come to a screeching halt? With at least one comic book hero, a Mormon named “Cypher” from the New Mutants, and the incredible success of Napoleon Dynamite, will LDS characters go mainstream? It's worked that way before for evangelical Protestants. Ned Flanders, Homer Simpson's goofy next door neighbor, put a human and humorous face on evangelicals for people whose only previous exposure was to dour, cable TV gasbags. Although skeptical at first, church youth workers on college campuses found that young Christians had recognized in Ned a kindred spirit and had adopted him as a lovable mascot. At least one prominent Protestant mega-church pastor likes to wear a “Vote for Pedro” T-shirt. Mark I. Pinsky's journalism career began in the 1960s at Duke University, where he wrote a column called “The Readable Radical” for the campus daily. After graduation, he worked for several underground papers before heading to Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and respectability by earning his M.S.J. Mark spent most of the 1970s in the Southeast as a free lance writer, primarily covering racial and criminal justice trials and focusing on the death penalty for outlets like the New York Times. After living and working in China in 1982-83, his first regular, full-time job came in 1985, staff writer for the Los Angeles Times' Orange County Edition. At the Times, he wrote about religion, the performing arts and philanthropy and, again, courts and criminal justice. Mark became religion writer and senior reporter at the Orlando Sentinel in 1995, specializing in coverage of evangelical Christianity in the Sun Belt.",

But what about the man in the midst of this flurry of activity? In his March 1987 Sunstone reflection, son Edward L. Kimball suggested that several personal characteristics animated his father's service as Church president: he loved to interact with people; he had a sense of humor; he had a feeling of personal insignificance or inadequacy; he tried harder than anyone else. Now, some thirty years after that article and in the wake of the long-awaited publication of a book on the presidency of Spencer W. Kimball, how does the author view the intersection of man and events today?",

      "Presenters": "Scot Denhalter, M.A.",
      "Description": " Truth-Telling And Mormonism This session features two reflections on the issue of Mormon truth-telling. Scot Denhalter's presentation focuses on the musings of Princeton moral philosopher Henry G. Frankfurt about a quality of misrepresentation that falls on the continuum between telling the truth and lying (somewhere just short of a lie), which he names “bullshit.” Denhalter asks if this type of discourse exists in Mormon culture and, if so, to what extent? Is there a different type of it in Mormonism than is found elsewhere? Does the Church employ social mechanisms that increase or decrease the incidence of “b.s.” in Mormon culture? Ryan Wimmer explores a religious principle, taqiyah, that Shi'a Muslims use as a means to protect their faith. Taqiyah means to “safeguard or defend” as well as “to fear” (as in the sense of being pious) and allows members of the faith to be untruthful when their life or religious faith is in danger. Wimmer argues that a similar principle exists in Mormonism, though it's unnamed and has yet to achieve a recognized status as an aid to faith. He asks, “Should it?”",

Mormonism contains a highly developed theology and practice of embodied spirituality, and the arts are an important aspect of the Restoration, inextricably intertwined with the Sacred Feminine.",

The appearance of a popular new blog, “Feminist Mormon Housewives,” signals the rise of a new wave of feminism within mainstream Mormonism as another generation of Mormon women confronts the problems of gender inequity within the Church. How is blogging, with its capacity to reach large numbers of people without requiring anything of them but Internet access, along with its ability to provide both the security of anonymity and the power of the personal voice, affecting the possibilities of feminism within the LDS Church? Will open Internet communication help Mormon women be more aware of the problems of gender inequity in the Church and enable them to meet these challenges without being forced to choose between Mormonism and feminism?",

By the same token, too many intellectuals have as cavalierly dismissed Mormonism's fundamental truth claims. As a people, we need to extend ourselves beyond the narrow confines of complacent wariness and dismissal of “the other” and respect the role of faith as we distinguish between accidentals and the restored gospel's unavoidable essentials.",

The story eventually made headlines in Time magazine, the Washington Post, and the Chronicle of Higher Education, among numerous other publications, and was declared one of Utah's Top Five Stories of the Year. Joseph Vogel, the former student body vice president primarily responsible for the decision to invite Moore, and author of the recently published book, Free Speech 101, will speak of this experience and what it revealed about such significant issues as culture and religion, diversity and tolerance, faith and fear.",

Wotherspoon speaks of his own sustained immersion in liminality and talks of a community that is created by like-minded searchers. But, by definition, can liminality be sustained? Is it more likely that someone born into Mormonism will be a liminalist longer than would a convert, especially in evaluating the truth claims of the faith? Is this related to the processes involved in resolving inner conflicts? What role does courage play in the conclusions one comes to? This presentation is from two perspectives: that of a father who is still part of the community Wotherspoon describes, and that of a son who has observed the community from the outside, more as an alien anthropologist.",

Toward Healthy Communication With Teenagers About Sex Most Latter-day Saint parents would rather talk about anything with their children other than sexual desire. Is it because we have only one context in which to put the experience of sexual feelings outside marriage: sin? We recognize the potency of our drives and the complex consequences that follow from sexual activity before a person is ready, so it's natural that we are hesitant to let teenagers loose in such a charged area. But are there healthy ways to talk with our teenagers and young adult children about sex? Does Mormonism have resources for a better framing of intense sexual interest than its being Satan's most effective means of leading people carefully into hell? Dante only got to heaven by first journeying into hell. How can we be better Virgil's, better guides for our teenagers as they negotiate the difficult terrain of sexual desire?",

Kimball arrived late last year with far less fanfare than it deserved. According to the book's preface, the author and publisher Deseret Book “[did] not agree on the interpretations or weight of importance given to a number of events or the choices of characterizations of some of the people” in the book. Although disagreements and compromises are part of every author/publisher interaction, the inclusion of this statement has led to considerable speculation about the limited marketing campaign the book has enjoyed, as well as about what wild statements might be lurking in more extensively footnoted version of the book on the CD-Rom packaged with it.",

      "Description": " Screening Of New York Doll And Discussion With Director Greg Whiteley New York Doll is a film that captures one of those rare occasions where life is not only stranger but also better than fiction. As the founding member of the visionary rock group The New York Dolls, Arthur “Killer” Kane belonged to a select group of musicians widely credited as the definitive proto-glam-punk ensemble. The Dolls pioneered a look and sound that paved the way for the punk and glam rock Dolls look-alikes who would follow in the next decade. Unfortunately, like many other bands, the Dolls crashed and burned amidst a flurry of drug and alcohol abuse. Fast forward thirty years, and find 55-year-old Arthur riding the bus to his job at the LDS Family History Center Library in Los Angeles. Arthur had converted to Mormonism in 1989 after answering an ad in TV Guide. His life is calmer, but he still dreams of reuniting with the Dolls and returning to life as a musician. Enter Greg Whiteley, a filmmaker and member of Arthur's ward, who believes Arthur's life story would make a wonderful short documentary and begins interviewing him. As they are moving ahead with this project, they learn that Morrissey, the legendary former lead singer of The Smiths and a huge fan of the Dolls, would like to have the band reunite for a huge music festival in London he is organizing. This breaking news, combined with the fact that Whiteley's interviews with Arthur were beginning to “look like a film,” emboldens the filmmaker to envision his modest project more ambitiously. What had initially begun as a short profile of Arthur's strange journey from rock god to lost soul to LDS Family History worker was becoming a bigger idea. The completed film, New York Doll, is a 76-minute documentary that has excited audiences at festivals, including the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and in theatrical release. The film features interviews about the Dolls and Arthur with rock legends Morrissey, Bob Geldolf, Chrissie Hynde, Mick Jones, Iggy Pop, and others. It also features interviews with Arthur's friends at the Family History Library (who pitch in to help Arthur get his guitars out of hock so he can begin practicing for the reunion). The film depicts many poignant moments leading up to Arthur's reunion with the other surviving members of the Dolls and their triumphant comeback at the 2004 Meltdown Festival.",

The Conflict Between Gender Difference And Equality In Mormonism This presentation examines three sets of related inquiries to the question, “Are boys more important than girls?” (1) What kind of equality does God's justice demand to fulfill the scriptural exhortation that we are all “alike unto God”? Can gender difference and equality coexist? (2) Can equality be measured objectively? Are there certain criteria we should look for? Do we find them in the Church? Or is equality a subjective matter? If LDS women feel equal, is that sufficient? (3) Does the Church have the moral duty to promote equality within its organization? And should, or can, members work for change in an organization that is run by priesthood authority?",

The resulting public scare, though limited, was born of a mixture of anti-cult activity, political interests, a helping of sensation-making journalism, and the distinctly American image of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. What can happen when political interests and Mormon activities clash in a foreign country? How might the public association of Mormonism with the U.S. factor into the Church's desire to become a “world religion”?",

Regarding doctrine, Joseph Smith saw the Church and the Latter-day Saints themselves in the stage of infancy. According to him, there is a vast reservoir of religious knowledge available to any who ask and seek and are prepared to receive. Given Smith's many declarations, why don't we see more diversity among today's Latter-day Saints?",

The Dilemma For Mormon Artists And Whether There's A Way Out Why do so many Mormon artists find themselves torn between the Church and their art, feeling that they're leading two very different lives that are difficult to reconcile? Why do so many of us feel that we have to make a choice between being loyal to their Church and loyal to their art? Is it simply that, as the Bible suggests, “No man can serve to masters, for either he will hate the one and despise the other, or he will hold to the one and despise the other”? Is Art a master that challenges faith and God? Or is it more complicated than that? Orson F. Whitney suggested that Mormonism would “yet have Miltons and Shakespeares of our own” and for years people have been talking about the “Great Mormon Novel” being just on the horizon. Yet is it really possible for a great artist to exist within a religious structure such as Mormonism? Brian Evenson will talk about the pressures he experienced when his first book, Altmann's Tongue, cost him his job at Brigham Young University, and the path he followed from feeling that he could personally reconcile his art and his faith to being put in a position where he felt like he had to make a choice between the two. Are there ways of thinking about the relation between faith and art that will allow us not to compromise either, that can allow for a symbiotic relationship that a religious structure can not only understand but encourage?

      "Description": " A Testimony Of Motherhood: LDS Response To Changing Women's Roles, 1940-2006 Most conservative religions objected to the movement of women out of the household in the 1960s, but doctrines linked to the practice of polygamy made changing gender roles particularly challenging for the LDS Church. To understand Church responses to this crisis, I analyzed all general conference talks and Improvement Era and Ensign articles on gender from 1940 to 2006. They show the Church harshly criticizing change, then accommodating it without really changing, and finally creating a new boundary between itself and its social environment. By stressing the positive aspects of its difference with contemporary society, the Church convinced members to adhere to doctrines that might otherwise have resulted in a loss of authority.",

The most important set of LDS interests is represented by “faithful scholarship,” which has come to set the standard of acceptable scholarship about Mormonism for many Latter-day Saints poised to help shape the emerging subfield as scholars, students, donors, and local community constituents. How did faithful scholarship become the dominant normative model for LDS scholars, replacing relatively more anti-intellectual and more naturalistic outlooks in the process?

My new book, Victim of the Muses, looks at the origins of poetics in western civilization from this perspective. The poet as prophet (Marsyas, Aesop, or Socrates, grotesquely ugly and a warrior with words) was often offensive to sophic society and became the pharmakos, or scapegoat, killed or cast out by political leaders.

The show centers on the family of Bill Hendrickson, the owner of a growing chain of home-improvement stores who owns three homes of his own, each occupied by one of his wives and their children. HBO is known for producing series that explore unusual families (The Sopranos, Six Feet Under). But suburban polygamy? Given its uncomfortable history with its polygamist past and the great lengths the Church has gone to in order to distinguish today's Mormonism from its nineteenth-century incarnation, LDS leaders have been less than comfortable with the series, urging producers to place disclaimers in the credits and issuing statements to the press and local Mormon leaders clarifying the current LDS stance toward the practice of polygamy. In contrast, however, some Latter-day Saints are quietly pleased that Big Love has come along because it is forcing a fresh discussion of polygamy and the difficult balancing act Church leaders have tried to perform over the past century of renouncing the practice while never denouncing the doctrine of plural marriage. In this session, panelists will talk about the series and the issues it raises. How many families like the Hendricksons live in the United States today? How accurate are the series’ portrayals of the joys and trials of plural families? What might the fallout, both positive and negative, be for the LDS Church now that the series has become a hit and will be a player in America's culture wars?",

Recent poems by Paul Swenson (“Violence, Adult Content,” “Trans Sexual,” “Stare Decisis,” “Blue in a Red State” and “In the Beginning”) explore tensions between a questioning faith and stereotypical male expectations in LDS culture. Rigby, Abbott, and Swenson will read from their works and discuss implications for Mormon audiences.",

Assessing the Multiple Causes of the Willie and Martin Handcart Disaster.” All four pointed the finger at Apostle Franklin D. Richards, who rightly deserves his share of the blame for the disaster. But I believe it is also time to take a hard look at the person who designed, promoted, and insisted on maintaining the handcart system long after its critical flaws had been revealed: Brigham Young. This presentation examines long-ignored evidence identifying what was wrong with what Danish handcart pioneer John A. Ahmanson called “those two-wheeled man-tormentors,” which I have translated more freely as “torture devices.” Have historians of the disaster “put the saddle on the right horse”?",

These are: (1) the lust for sexual purity (what I call “schoolmarmery”), (2) the obsession with material success (“success-mongery”), and (3) the demand for infallible leadership (“sycophancy”). How did puritanical attitudes and religious sex taboos come to eclipse American concerns for individual civil liberties and tolerance? How can these damaging irreligious obsessions be exposed and opposed in the public sector?",

Why? Was the experience a fabrication, as argued by Dan Vogel and Grant Palmer? I have located decisive evidence on this question, in the Book of Mormon itself. Exploring Book of Mormon material recorded in May 1829 reveals the authority under which Joseph and Oliver baptized one another and demonstrates the role the Book of Mormon played in its reception. Based on these findings, I propose a new paradigm for understanding the Book of Mormon.",

It forces one to confront the questions “Just what do I believe?” and “What are the issues, ideas, and concepts that animate my religious life?” The sharing of these core religious doctrines and ideas from one person's life inspires others.",

Because of the theological significance of Romans in Christian history and the nature of Joseph's edits, this part of his biblical revision is of a different sort than other, more expansive portions such as the Book of Moses. Although Joseph's method, the actual correcting of the Bible text, was characteristically idiosyncratic, it certainly wasn't without analogues, particularly in the context of growing nineteenth-century doubts about scriptural purity and worries about the pitfalls of translation. How does Joseph's work fit in with these worries and other attempts to answer theological questions by making adjustments to scripture?",

      "Description": " Dissenting Opinions: Art From The Dark Side Of Happy Valley Mormon teachings depict the universe as driven by a plan, a plotline in which good will assuredly triumph over evil. Humans are believed to be essentially divine beings who will ultimately respond in accord with their truest nature. Given this framework, Mormons (like most people) generally prefer their art to reflect this optimism, to reinforce cherished notions and values. Yet in Brian Evenson and Neil LaBute, Mormonism has at least partially given birth to artists who have deliberately chosen to create stories that don't pan out the way they're supposed to, in which heroes don't win out and villains often walk in the world unmolested. Or worse, artists who in many cases refuse to identify any moral framework or make any ethical judgment on the actions of their characters. What are these artists thinking? How can they defend their choices to show unrepentant and unredeemed selfishness, delusion, obsession, violence, and cruelty? In filmmaker Richard Dutcher, one finds another LDS artist whose films, though certainly depicting a brighter ethical universe, often portray Mormon characters with deep flaws who don't always come around, a storyteller willing to shine a light on problems and the ragged edges of too-easy answers. What happens when LDS artists stretch boundaries? Why do they do it? What do we learn about ourselves as individuals and a culture in the ways we react to their work?",

      "Description": " Eternal Families: The Doctrine Joseph Smith Never Taught In the new movie, Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration, Joseph declares to his family: “We can be with the ones we love forever.” Compared to what Joseph actually taught about the sociality of heaven, that statement is anachronistic. In this presentation, I trace the complex, dramatic changes that Mormon teachings about the “heavenly family” have undergone since Joseph Smith's days. Does the ubiquitous slogan “families can be together forever” have more to do with a current LDS preoccupation with nuclear families than with Joseph's teaching?",

Many Saints proudly embrace the official snack food of Utah as a whimsical symbol of our peculiarity. Yet are we any more peculiar than the Lutherans of Minnesota or the Methodists of the South, who are also known for their predilection for Jell-O? Is there really a “Jell-O belt” running from Idaho through Utah and into Arizona? Or does the Mormon affinity for Jell-O parallel the growing sweet tooth of the American middle class and serve as further evidence of Mormon assimilation into popular culture?",

The book elucidates the classic hero's journey in a fascinating parable featuring a Polynesian fisherman lost at sea, threatening volcanoes, witch doctors, human sacrifices, dolphin guides, and ultimate transcendence. Ever had trouble explaining your own private journey beyond what's spelled out in the Gospel Doctrine manual? This is the book to give the doubting Thomases in your life. In this session, Kenny Kemp will read excerpts from Oki's Island, which New York Times best-selling author James Michael Pratt calls ““the most exhilarating quest adventure since Jonathan Livingston Seagull.”",

And the Church, governed and structured by the priesthood, contains many inequalities.

For this reason, they have attempted to continue polygamy after President Joseph F. Smith stopped approving plural sealings in April 1904. Also, modern polygamists usually affirm that all exalted men are polygamists. Does religious history bear this out? Do the scriptures?",

More than twenty films have emerged since then, some produced to have crossover appeal (e.g., The Other Side of Heaven and Dutcher's films, including his newest, States of Grace), others unabashedly insular, relying on Mormon in-humor and banking on LDS religiosity (e.g., The Singles Ward, The R.M., Day of Defense).

Bengt Washburn has an M.F.A. in painting from Indiana University in Bloomington. He taught art part time at local universities while applying for teaching positions at crappy colleges all over America. Bengt finally gave up on his painting/art teaching career after reading about Congo the Chimp, a prolific painting monkey with “art” in galleries, museums, and private collections all over the globe. After nine years of toil, his bank account and résumé© were inferior to those of a trained monkey. Since switching to comedy, Bengt has performed in comedy clubs and on college campuses all over the United States. In 2001, he won the prestigious San Francisco International Comedy Competition, and just this past year was invited to perform at the very cool Vancouver International Comedy Festival. Bengt has two DVDs, Mormon Meets World and Hell Bengt (both of which will be available at the performance). He is currently developing a 75-minute show that should be hitting stages (theatres, not comedy clubs) this fall.",

What is more dangerous is that it jolted one of Clifton Jolley's children, his eldest daughter, who called him seeking explanation. A father's instinct to defend his daughter against the evils of DNA research seduced Jolley out of his retirement from Mormonism to investigate and explain the pragmatics and polemics of DNA research as a commentary on the heritage of the Lamanite remnant in the Americas. Although Lobdell is suspicious of the Book of Mormon as history, he used to remark on how “nice” Mormons are. Now he says: “That was before I met Clifton Jolley.”",

Although never popular, some varieties of reincarnation have proven more heretical than others, and Church leaders have often given mixed messages on the subject. By the end of the nineteenth century, however, it had gained its modern association with schismatics and fundamentalists.

Hitchcock never indicated the origin of the monologue nor why he wanted it, leaving many Hitchcock experts to speculate (incorrectly) on its origins. How are we to explain this and several other subtle echoes of Mormonism in Hitchcock’s final movie? Based on research at the Hitchcock archives, as well as interviews with the film’s assistant director, sound editor, and Patricia Hitchcock (Alfred’s daughter), this presentation argues that the passages are an important element in interpreting Hitchcock’s final movie, and that Family Plot offers an implicit commentary on Mormonism as well.",

But it has a negative side in the way that it frequently leads us to slip into conventional patterns that discourage thought and encourage conformity. By selecting active, precise, and living language, we can force ourselves to question our assumptions, challenge our faith, and ultimately elevate our testimonies. This session explores the encroachment of institutional language into our faith expressions. It also includes several group exercises, including experiments with E-prime, a conventional form of English that forbids use of any conjugated form of the verb “to be.” Let’s see what a little experimenting can accomplish with common testimony phrases such as, “I know the Church is true,” if we can’t use the word “is”!",

They catch the swift thought of God and reveal it to us.” This proposal presents two close examinations of Joseph Smith as poet: the psalm of anguish recoverable in his letter from Liberty Jail (published as part of D&C 121 and 122); and the oral rhythms and lyric nature of Smith's 27 November 1832 letter to William W. Phelps. Since Smith dictated both letters, the rhythms recoverable are the rhythms of his speech and represent a voice as distinctly American as Walt Whitman's.",

This presentation explores these connections and suggests ways that Mormons can significantly complement their own practices with those of these other traditions, along with newly developed integral spiritual practices and techniques from Western therapeutic and developmental psychology.",

When everything one knows about being human comes from Utah, about being American comes from Las Vegas (where Steven was raised), and about being gay comes from the penthouses of Manhattan, BE VERY AFRAID.

      "Description": "Sunstone is thrilled to host the world premiere of a new film, Peculiarities. Initially written by Brigham Young University professor Eric Samuelsen as a play, the film version has emerged as a true cooperative venture by the writer, director, crew, and cast, who have all worked on the film for free. Of Peculiarities’s origins, Samuelsen says: Ever since I began teaching at BYU in 1992, I’ve become a bemused student of Mormon culture, intrigued by its idiosyncrasies and oddities and inconsistencies. Every so often, my observations have resulted in plays: Gadianton, The Way We’re Wired, Without Romance, and others. peculiarities is the result of conversations I’ve had with the LDS young people I teach and interact with. Mormon culture tends to preach a “letter of the law” approach to moral questions, and especially in regards to issues of sexual morality. And so I became aware of some of the peculiar ways in which moral rigidity and sexuality collide in our culture. It occurred to me that combining all these stories and practices into a single play might make for a compelling evening in the theatre. I was especially taken with the idea of presenting this material naturalistically, simply showing the stories of these flawed human characters without apology, explanation, or mediation, presuming a morally centered audience and allowing that audience the space to reach their own conclusions about the issues raised by these stories. And so, sometime around 1999, I wrote Peculiarities. The film features six separate stories, exploring difficult topics not to glorify poor decisions nor to make fun of the moral attitudes and inconsistencies that lead the characters to make those decisions, but to illustrate and better understand their consequences. Noted LDS storyteller Orson Scott Card says, “Mormons can no more live by empty, meaningless art that pretends to be moral because it is devoid of any relation to reality than the rest of the world can live by art that scoffs at morality and presents a view of life as a meaningless, pointless, undirected accident.” Peculiarities strives to be moral art that is at the same time effective as art.",

We've managed brief glimpses into his intellectual and spiritual life through various panelist and respondent stints, including his 1996 “Pillars of My Faith” address. We got a sense of the wide variety of his passions and interests in the short “Sunstone Gallery” feature in the January 2002 Sunstone. But what do we really know about Ardean Watts? Friends, it's time for the full load! Join us for a delightful tour of a colorful, musical, and extraordinarily joyful life. After proper cajoling, this maestro has graciously agreed to take up the baton (we mean remote control) and conduct us on a pictoral, personally narrated and properly soundtracked trip through events and people, ideas and loves that animate this most animated of lives. Ardean will lead us through everything from beginnings and mission to Utah symphony, opera, and arts, environmental, and peace activism; from university teaching to church service and his own form of “course correction”; from family and friends to birding and mushrooms, including travels on four continents. And, as anyone who knows Ardean might expect, the touch will be light and the emphasis, irreverent! There can be no better way to close your experience at this symposium exploring Mormonism and artistic culture than joining with the Sunstone community in celebrating our great friend Ardean and the series of fortunate events that have shaped this wonderful, vibrant soul.",

However, many feel a great deal of ambivalence towards this decision, since leaving the Church often has very serious familial, social, occupational, and even psychological implications. Many members caught at this crossroads see only two paths: (1) stay active as a full-blown, 100 percent traditional member, or (2) cease all meaningful affiliation with the Church. In this workshop, JOHN DEHLIN discusses “middle way” strategies for maintaining Church involvement even when one is feeling out of the mainstream of Mormon life and belief. The workshop format consists of a formal presentation of about an hour, followed by group sharing and discussion.",

COM.) This article argues that faithful Latter-day Saints may appropriately harmonize the biblical account of the Flood with the massive scientific evidence against an inundation of global dimensions by reinterpreting the biblical account as applying to a regional flood. It calls for mutual respect between Latter-day Saints who believe in a literal interpretation and those who interpret the account more figuratively.

It declares that same-sex attractions are not considered sinful but affirms that acting on those attractions is incompatible with God’s plan for families in the afterlife. It urges same-sex-attracted LDS members to remain active in the Church and asks other members to treat them with love and respect.

For me, making documentaries is an elaborate creative and spiritual project, one of balancing and layering, of crawling inside the revelation of another religion. I will outline the complicated process of making The Mormons and illustrate it with behind-thescenes stories and guiding strategies that will, I hope, help us better understand the never-ending dance Mormonism has with the media, and vice versa. I will detail my preparation process, including the challenge of persuading PBS to commission a documentary on Mormons, and the overwhelming tasks of understanding Mormonism, of gaining access, reading stacks of books and articles, interviewing hundreds of experts and lay folk, many of whom first had to get permission to talk to me. For The Mormons, I wanted to create a thematic work, not a chronological history. Our challenge was to determine what are the defining events, ideas of Mormonism? How can we describe some, but not all, of Mormonism's big bold ideas without getting lost in a theology lesson? How might we tell some, but not all, of the history and not get lost in a chronological swamp of names and events? How might we establish balance when examining the truth claims of Mormonism without either endorsing/selling the religion or subjecting it to inappropriate attack? We interviewed some 1,000 people before we began filming. Our primary challenge then was to find the right personal mini-dramas and especially people who speak without deadening piety or platitudes. Then there was the search for images! How might we visually suggest the shockingly literal nature of Mormonism but not allow the film's metaphors to be taken literally? Finally, I will speak about the response of non-Mormons to the documentary and what these reactions tell us about the relationship between Mormons and mainstream America. I will also share what surprised me most in making this documentary, personally and professionally.",

      "Description": " 'IS THE UNITED STATES READY FOR A MORMON PRESIDENT?' MORMONISM AS A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE 2008 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN The presidential campaign of Mitt Romney has generated significant attention to his beliefs and practices as an active Mormon. A great deal of media attention has focused on the central question: Is the United States ready to elect a Mormon President? In exploring this question, I will draw comparisons with George Romney's 1968 campaign for president, who, like his son Mitt, was a devout Latter-day Saint. Why does Mormonism appear to be a more controversial issue vis a vis Mitt Romney's pursuit of the White House than it was forty years ago when his father sought the same office?",

In this illustrated essay, I follow the tortuous history of Joseph Smith's bones, secret burials, exhumations, family feuds, and even the speculation that Smith has already been resurrected.

The need to continue a religious dialogue with the LDS church requires the knowledge of the Church's juridical structure of marriage in its similarities and differences with the Roman Catholic Church.

One might watch this film and see Kane as being redeemed by his conversion, as given meaning by his job at the family history center, and as rewarded by the reunion of the New York Dolls at the Morrissey Meltdown festival. This is too simplistic. Kane's nostalgia for his former life as a raunchy rock star is apparent from the opening of the film and not indicative of a simple LDS conversion story. Kane's bishop's advice about reconciling with his former bandmates and his ward members' help to retrieve his pawned guitars bring together two worlds usually rent apart. The atonement between these communities is the theology of the film, a theology reflected in audience reactions as much as in the film itself.",

In the course of constructing their religion, Mormons began to see themselves as special descendants meant to congregate together on chosen land, and they believed that they shared a common bloodline heretofore unknown to them. I explore the religious rhetoric that created a people, the common experiences that strengthened that identity, the factors that diminished it in the last century, and how that identity now affects the way Mormons act and are perceived in the world today.",

When most people read Ephesians 5:23, “For the husband is the head of his wife the way Christ is the head of the Church,” they cannot help but understand “head” to mean “ruler,” “leader,” or some other form of “authority over.” And since Latter-day Saints believe the Bible to be the “word of God, as far as it is translated correctly,” that means the husband's the boss, right? In fact, “authority over” is not a correct translation of kephale (head). I will show that instead of mandating hierarchy in marriage, Paul actually is instructing husbands to behave in such a way that they grow in unity and love with their wives. I will also explore the implications of this simile for how the church should be “headed.”",

The Mormons will certainly be one of the tradition's primary public faces for many years to come. How well-suited is it for this role?

Both ideologies look forward to the abolition of government and the building of a socialist society based on free association and cooperation. Attempting to argue such a case seems perplexing, given the generally pro-capitalist, pro-government, pro-war stance of many American Mormons. Such attitudes exist despite resources within Mormon scripture advocating the contrary, and sadly lead to Mormon support for militarism, imperialism, and economic and other kinds of exploitation. It is important that Latter-day Saints do not see the establishment of capitalism as the end of history, but rather actively strive to establish a society and economic system in accordance with the principles contained in their own sacred writings.",

      "Description": " UNQUIETING WOMEN'S VOICES IN THE GENERAL MEMBERSHIP OF THE LDS CHURCH and MOLLY MORMONS CAN BE REIKI MASTERS, TOO Many LDS women unnecessarily place self-imposed restrictions on their roles, rights, and responsibilities by inferring limitations on their behavior that do not actually appear in Church doctrine or policy. Men and women have different roles and responsibilities within the church but equal responsibility to gain the skills and knowledge necessary for full participation in public church life. Through authoritative self-definition and expression, increased recognition, respect for the diversity of women's experience, and validation of female independence, the oversimplified conceptions of “women's role” in the Church could be broadened to be much more substantial, and women's doctrinal reliances could be focused more inwardly.",

      "Description": " THE BOOK OF MORMON'S VIEW OF GODHEAD: NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE An understanding of the theological framework and substance of the Book of Mormon has been frustrated over time because of the Church’s shifting doctrines concerning the Godhead. This situation has led many Latter-day Saints to interpret Book of Mormon Trinitarian language in light of current doctrine—a project that yields unsatisfying results. A key to interpreting the Book of Mormon’s theology of God is in Ethan Smith’s A Treatise on the Character of Jesus Christ, and on the Trinity in Unity of the Godhead (1814). The treatise offers fascinating insights for those of us who have never found explanations of the Book of Mormon’s views on the Godhead to make much sense.",

      "Description": " MORMONISM'S 'MITT MOMENT' Even more than the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics did, Mitt Romney's early success in his run for President of the United States has brought media and water-cooler attention to Mormon teachings and practice. Polls revealing in some cases that a third or more potential voters would have strong hesitations in voting for a Mormon candidate have caught many Latter-day Saints off guard. Is Mormonism still such a lightning rod, still so associated with the claims of cultishness, still so misunderstood in terms of its current versus past practices and teachings so as to elicit this kind of a priori rejection of a candidate simply because of his faith tradition? This panel of careful and astute Mormon-watchers from backgrounds in different fields and from both without and within the LDS church wrestles with Mormonism's present and speculates about its future courtesy of this “Mitt moment.” How will his Mormon faith affect his run for the Republican nomination? And how might those dynamics shift were he to receive that nod and run in the general election? And what might the dynamics be should he become President? Conversely, what effects will his officeseeking and very public profile have upon Mormonism? What will come as LDS doctrines past and present are lifted up for examination in the public arena? Will “outsider” eyes force Mormon leaders and members to re-examine commitments to various doctrines, practices, and aspects of its history? How might all of this unfold?",

Today, self-proclaimed progressive BYU students are increasingly adopting political and humanitarian causes, from the conflict in Sudan to protesting the war in Iraq. In the fall of 2006, students organized a protest over the firing of Todd Hendricks, a student body association advisor who had publicly called for greater transparency in student elections. In 2007, a sit-in protested the invitation of Vice President Dick Cheney to speak at commencement, and BYU students organized a “BYU Alternative Commencement” that not only challenged the political nature of the invitation but also the school's never-before-examined commencement tradition. This panel discussion will featurefilm footage from the protests and will address these events and the future of activism at BYU.",

Recent years have seen massive growth in the community of LDS blogs, often called the “bloggernacle.” These blogs draw thousands of readers and offer many potential benefits, from real-time, interactive analyses of current events to interviews with scholars and celebrities. Media outlets from the Salt Lake Tribune to the New York Times regularly rely on LDS bloggers for Mormon perspectives. In some ways, the bloggernacle hasbecome one of the more visible faces ofMormonism. But just how accurately does the bloggernacle represent Mormons and Mormonism? Are there demographic or ideological biases in the bloggernacle? Are certain groups excluded, women, or gays, or even conservatives? Can the bloggernacle really represent mainstream Mormonism while also providing an accurate window into the many different demographic and ideological subgroups within the Mormon community? Should it even try to? Join a panel of bloggers and blogwatchers to discuss these and related issues. Moderator JOHN FOWLES is an attorney now living with his wife and three children in London, England. He has co-operated with his brother the LDS-themed blog A Bird's Eye View (HTTP://ABEV.WORDPRESS.COM) since July 2004. Currently, John also blogs at Mormon Mentality (MORMONMENTALITY.ORG).",

The volume contains sixteen essays on different expressions of the Latter Day Saint movement that have emerged since Joseph Smith Jr. organized the Church of Christ in 1830. Among those included in the volume are groups who trace their path through Sidney Rigdon, James J. Strang, Alpheus Cutler or Granville Hedrick. Also included are historic (no longer extent) branches of the movement that were led by David Whitmer, William Smith and Amasa Lyman. Finally the volume outlines the history of fundamentalist Mormonism and recent schisms within the Reorganized Latter Day Saint tradition",

Many may not know, however, that neither has ever been a member of the Church. In this session, Sunstone celebrates these two appreciative outsiders and highlights their decades long walk alongside their Latter-day Saint friends. What drew them to and continues to engage them about Mormonism and Mormon studies? What role does their sojourn among the Mormons play in their own faith journeys? Come meet and celebrate these two amazing friends and teachers.",

EMBODIMENT AND THE KING FOLLETT DISCOURSE The LDS doctrine of deity differs radically from the traditional Christian concept of the Trinity, and this difference is a major point of contention between Mormons and other Christians. But LDS scriptures themselves present many points of conflict with the Church's official doctrine of deity, which gives priority to the Pearl of Great Price account of the First Vision and the King Follett Discourse. I will analyze the notion of embodiment and use it as a way of bringing the various concepts of God into dialogue, exploring the question, “What kind of a being is God?”",

The underlying dividing issue is what constitutes the “sure word of God.” Marcus Borg frames the different perceptions of God's Word in an “earlier” and “emerging” paradigm. Using Borg'smodel, I suggest that what is happening in the Episcopal Church is also occurring in the LDS church, though quieter and with less drama. The “schism” is between those who are certain the LDS Church has God's final word and those who are less certain but still find a spiritual edification within the psychological and sociological framework of the institution.",

      "Description": " A MORMON AMONG THE REPARATIONISTS; A REPARATIONIST AMONG THE MORMONS Recently, there has been an increase in discussions about reparations to Blacks. Many proposals call for some combination of investigation, apology, and monetary compensation to slave descendants. As a Mormon and a reparations advocate, I'm in a no-man's-land. Colleagues who support reparations have negative views of the Church, and Church friends are skeptical of the idea of reparations. Both sides can learn from each other. For example, reparations scholarship can draw on the history of Mormon claims for redress. Similarly, there are many reasons, based on Mormon doctrine, culture, and history, why Latter-day Saints should support slavery reparations. In this 150th anniversary year of the Mountain Meadows Massacre, we need to think seriously about concepts such as group harm, restitution, atonement, and reconciliation. Slavery reparations provides a good lens for this examination.",

Gnosticism and shamanism practice techniques of “knowing”, entering spiritual dimensions and experiencing the ineffable, both heavenly and hellish. Derivative forms of these ancient traditions were practiced in upstate New York during Joseph Smith's formative years. Interestingly, shamans and Gnostics used certain psychotropic plants and fungi during rituals and ceremonies to facilitate trance states. Used in this setting, psychoactive substances are often called “entheogen,” meaning to manifest “God within.” I will review the use of entheogens in shamanic and Gnostic traditions and the evidence that puts Joseph Smith in proximity to their use. It will also show how the use of entheogens can reproduce many of the paranormal and mythmaking abilities Joseph manifested.",

But a remarkable answer to prayer, “This is the restored gospel and you are to join,” led him to put aside his strong aversion to the then- current policies and trust in God's goodness. The answer he received was so powerful that it has provided the grounding for his testimony ever since. And it had to be powerful to sustain him through the many challenges he has been called to go through in a life of service that has allowed him to advocate firsthand with prophets and apostles on issues affecting black Saints. Please join us for a wide-ranging interview with this remarkable Latter-day Saint, who, though not naturally blessed with patience with trials of body or promises delayed, still affirms that his life is “blessed,” that “God is in charge.”",

Through the image of the “yoke of Christ,” which I define as a full embodying of the principles and practices of divine communion and Non-Attachment as taught by Jesus and Yogis, we find a narrow but clear path to relieving the burdens of mortality and experiencing the lightness and joy of our divine nature. This path takes us through the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve and onto the cross with Jesus and ends, like the Prodigal's journey, in our Father's embrace.

      "Description": " STORYTELLING IN ZION When stories are told in institutional Mormon contexts, they stray from conventional storytelling in two ways. (1) The Joseph Campbell story structure always starts with a hero who must find an “elixir” to heal either an ailing community or him/herself, an elixir that can be found only outside the community, both spatially and ideologically. Claiming to be the only true church and unable to apostatize, the LDS church often sees such journeys as a threat. (2) These stories skip from a first act (the set-up) to a third act (the resolution), leaving out the second act: struggle. By leaving out this second act, institutionally told stories suggest there is no need to wrestle with angels or argue with God because the proper resolution of our struggles has been determined. We argue that we should embrace the challenge to “work out our own salvation” as an invitation to play God's fools.",

I look at the status of spiritual experience as the ground of commitment for one's life, its epistemic status and its spiritual significance. I argue that attacks claiming that such experiences are not trustworthy because they are merely ephemeral emotions are based on a caricature and unjustified reduction. In the hands of evangelicals, these critiques are self-refuting, incoherent, and contrary to scripture. The same attack from a secular perspective is also unjustifiably reductive and selfdefeating, but for different reasons. Religious experiences entail both cognitive and affective dimensions that, when synergistically joined, are a sound basis of commitment.There is a peculiar genius and beauty in religious commitment that is won by God one heart at a time.",

      "Description": " DOES GOD REALLY HATE AMPUTEES?, OR WHAT DOES SCIENCE AND REASON TELL US ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD? The title of this panel discussion comes from a website discussed by atheist Sam Harris in his book, Letter to A Christian Nation, that insists that there are no “answered” prayers that could not be written off as coincidence. Despite all of the healings from sickness or close calls averted, he says, God never, ever, heals an amputee, no matter how many people are praying it (and despite biblical promises that whatever is asked in faith can be received). Harris's book (as well as his lengthier The End of Faith), and Richard Dawkins's, The God Delusion, have become extremely popular, arguing intelligently from the position of science, human suffering, and biblical problems that there is almost certainly no supreme being or personal deity. Aside from the conviction of personal testimony, can science and reason be usedjust as convincingly for the existence of God? How might believers respond just as intelligently to the newly popular atheist movement? Are there aspects of these discussions that Latter-day Saints, in particular, might contribute to?",

This panel explores the reasons why, even with a recent decline in support among Utah Mormons, support for the war in Iraq is still significantly above the national average.

The stigma of shame has often led many LGBT members to experience their sexuality in shadow, cheating on spouses, meeting on the “down-low,” and drug abuse. However, years of hard-fought activism have effectively reduced the stigma of homosexuality in our culture. The result is a new generation of selfactualized, productive queer men and women. This panel will feature men and women with a Mormon upbringing who have thoughtfully embraced authentic gay lives. The panel will also address the recent Church pamphlet, God Loveth His Children, and suggest how embracing a queer-positive sexuality can empower those struggling with depression, anxiety, and conflict with both faith and family.",

In LDS culture, I hear people say “If it's God's will, it will happen” or “God will let me know if I need to do anything.” Then they are frustrated when their life isn't what they think it should be. I wonder when this amazing gift of personal revelation and inspiration became an excuse for not being active in one's life?

Joseph Smith stated that the vision of the celestial kingdom was received “while we meditated,” and Harold B. Lee admonished, “Don't get so busy that you don't have time to meditate. . . . Christ may be nearer than we have knowledge.” Several prophets of the Restoration have advocated relaxation and meditation in order to receive revelation. What can a guided meditative experience (popularly known as “regression session”) reveal to us? This will be a group experiential session with guided meditation and suggestions to help those attending hear the whisperings of the Spirit more clearly about personal issues.",

However, important questions remain unexplored in our attempt to better understand people of different faiths and ideological perspectives. The fact that only a small percentage of the human family has heard the gospel challenges us to think more carefully about the scope of the gospel and the place of religious diversity within it. This paper will attempt to clarify a few of the issues at stake in this discussion as Mormonism continues to develop in a variety of cultural and religious contexts.",

The Quetzalcoatl mythology is very complex and has undergone multiple transformations in the hands of those who have heard it and repeated it, a process that began with the early Spanish recorders of the myth and has its most recent elaboration in the Quetzalcoatl/Christ stories. This paper examines the documentary, iconographic, and archaeological evidence for the native Quetzalcoatl mythology and analyzes it against the possibility that it might have some connection to the Book of Mormon",

Many authors and historians have accepted this alleged scenario without consideration of the substantial and persuasive evidence that this is an extreme distortion. In the last few years, several hundred thousand books have been sold asserting that the Mountain Meadows Massacre was an act of vengeance in fulfillment of an oath sworn to by all participants in the endowment ceremony. This astounding assertion is made without any acknowledgment or examination of the testimony and evidence that no such oath was required in the endowment ceremony.

Following Jerald's death this past October, Sandra has continued to operate the ministry. Panelists in this session will examine the many contributions to Mormon studies made by these knowledgeable critics who, for the past few decades, have been pushing Latter-day Saint scholars and Church members to address important aspects of their faith and history.",

I argue that obedience culture influences have deteriorated America's moral leadership. The Patriot Act and U.S. military and civilian action in Iraq are two examples.

      "Description": " THE FERRYMAN'S DAUGHTER, PART 1: THE INSISTENT CALL OF MY MITOCHONDRIAL DNA While DNA science challenges such Mormon beliefs as Israelite ancestry for Native Americans, it promises fresh pursuits for genealogists. Particularly suggestive is our ability, publicized by Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes's Seven Daughters of Eve, to track mitochondrial DNA mutations to European “clan mothers”, and beyond them to African ancestresses. Traditionally overshadowed by male surname-conferring bloodlines, our matrilineal pedigree remains a vital influence on identity. This essay, an introduction to a work of creative nonfiction, examines how my own engagement with five hundred years and twelve generations of Germanic foremothers connects me to my genetic past, and to twelve long-lived North Friesian women, in ways likely to elude a genealogist focused on baptizing deceased relations. “Matrilineal genealogy” pays tribute to the women, named at the bottom of our pedigree charts, who publish their history in our genes.",

It seems that they have become more of a nice quotable bit of scripture than the startling message that came from Christ's mouth. Are we more concerned with what we have and do than with who we are?

Case in point: James McLachlan and Tom Kimball have been enjoying an ongoing discussion about their Mormon beliefs. Both have contemplated similar historical and philosophical dilemmas, and both are active in their home wards. One holds a current temple recommend while the other doesn't hold much hope of ever having one again. “Sin isn't the hold-up. For me, it is an issue of integrity as I don't believe in the Restoration,” says Tom. “But perhaps you do believe in the Restoration. It may only be a matter of what you think the “Restoration” means,” says Jim. Come listen in on and join their discussion!",

I examine evidence showing that, contrary to Smith's practice and shortly after his murder, LDS women were denied continued participation in the highest quorum of the church, were no longer anointed priestesses unto God, and were deprived of the Relief Society as a female priesthood organization. I explore how these blows to women's claim to priesthood theologically resulted in the vitiation of the doctrine of the fullness of the priesthood as the basis for the Quorum of the Twelve's claim to succeed Joseph Smith as successor, as well as the negative impact that the denial of priesthood fulness to women has had on the LDS church and the male priesthood contingent.",

      "Description": " IN THEIR ARMS AND UPON THEIR SHOULDERS: JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS UNSAFE TO BELIEVE IN THE BOOK OF MORMON, THE LAMANITES ARE MAD AS HELL! Since the first publication of the Book of Mormon, Mormons have covenanted with American Indians and Polynesians that they are the Lamanites. Recently, however, many Book of Mormon apologists have been cowed by evidence that American Indians are not trans-oceanic Israelites but descendants of Asiatic peoples, and as a result,have begun to retreat from traditional claims. But the Book of Mormon remnant are not so quick to surrender their birthright. Tribes such as the Havasupai have declined to participate in the National Geographic DNA definition of their history and religion. If Mormons are able to deny our paternalistic policies rather than betray our promises, if we can receive the example of indigenous peoples' loyal to their myths rather than vainly attempting to reconcile our historical faith with contemporary science, we may yet discover a better response to genome research by being carried in the arms and upon the shoulders of the Lamanites.",

Perhaps fewer members would feel “betrayed” by the Church when they encounter troubling information after being in the Church for years without being taught about discrepencies. But were the Church to more proactively engage in “information inoculation,” would so doing better serve faith and spiritual growth? What should the role of the Church as an institution be in doing this versus that of LDS independent and apologist groups? In the lead-up to the 150th anniversary of the Mountain Meadows Massacre in September, 2007, we are seeing a few Church-directed efforts to teach members about this terrible episode. Are we seeing an institutional shift in the way they will engage challenging issues from now on?",

And viewing the Mormon tradition broadly, “The Principle” is still a major public face as the Warren Jeffs trial, the HBO series Big Love, and other events and stories associated with those who practice plural marriage are regularly in the news. Adding to this mix of messages is the theological ambiguity of plural marriage that remains in mainstream LDS circles when one considers current sealing practices for widowers and the continued canonical status of D&C Section 132.

In the tradition of past Sunstone panels on human potential and women's spirituality, this panel explores the spiritual journey of Latter-day Saint women who embark on alternate paths through practices such as dreamwork, channeling, and earth-based ritual, and who maintain (though not without struggle) intimate relationships while engaging in extra-Mormon spiritual practices.",

Grant McMurray, former president of the Community of Christ, will reflect on the opportunities and challenges resulting from a Mormon candidacy for president of the United States. With the world now watching how the movement defines itself, he argues that the sectarian interpretations of Restorationorthodoxy areoften inadequate, and even worse, silly. If there is a contemporary contribution to be offered by the Restoration movement, it cannot rest on ludicrous claims to “all truth” or prophetic inerrancy. But the Romney campaign does unwittingly provide an opportunity to sift through the church's heritage in search of values and understandings that are credible in the broader culture of American society. What one finds, if looking through new eyes, is surprisingly visionary and thereby a worthy contributor to the dialogue so desperately needed in a world searching for community and yearning for peace.",

This situation has led many Latter-day Saints to interpret Book of Mormon understandings in light of current doctrine—a project that yields unsatisfying results. In December 2006, in an Irish rare book shop, I found a key to interpreting the Book of Mormon’s theology of God in Ethan Smith’s A Treatise on the Character of Jesus Christ, and on the Trinity in Unity of the Godhead (1814). The treatise offers fascinating insights for those of us who have devoted years of study to Joseph Smith’s narrative but have never found explanations for its views on the Godhead to make much sense.",

Critics of the Book of Mormon argue that it is unrealistic to believe that following four centuries of internecine conflict and violent struggle, peoples as warlike as the Nephites and Lamanites could have had two centuries of peace. The Book of Mormon itself provides the most convincing evidence that such peace is attainable. This paper examines the conditions that led up to that long season of peace and explores the reasons why so many generations refused to go to war. Finally, it attempts to draw parallels between Nephite history before, during, and after the coming of Christ to the New World and what is currently happening in the Valley of the Euphrates and how, at the beginning of the 21st century, we can begin shaping the peace that seems so essential.",

      "Description": "SW0712, Mormon tradition includes diverse teachings and prophecies concerning a future day of transfiguration, humans becoming physically immortal, the renewal of this world, the discovery and creation of worlds without end, and so forth. Yet our scriptures only hint about the human acts that might be needed for such things to come to be. Given that science and technology are among the most obvious manifestations of active faith in the future (fighting disease, improving communications, cleaning environments, extending life spans), how might we promote the application of science and technology to a Mormon view of the future and bring them into dialogue with the plan of salvation? Questions like this eventually led friends and me to become involved with Transhumanism, which has remarkable parallels and complements with Mormon views of the future.",

      "Description": " The Mormons: A Conversation with Helen Whitney In its write-up about the forthcoming documentary film series, The Mormons, the PBS website suggests that “Mormons have always had a peculiar hold on the American imagination, but few know who the Mormons actually are, or who they claim to be, and their story is one of the great neglected American narratives.” With this four-hour film meticulously researched and created by award-winning director Helen Whitney and set to debut on 30 April and 1 May as part of PBS's The American Experience and Frontline series, Mormons will be neglected no more! This high-profile film covers everything from Church origins, scripture, persecution, exodus, and nineteenth-century controversies to today's mainstreaming and emphases on families, missions, patriotism, and image, and how those play out in the lives of contemporary Latter-day Saints, both those who fit within the ideal and those who don't. We are thrilled to have Helen Whitney join us for this session of clips from this and others of her films (The Monastery; John Paul II; Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero) and conversation with the audience about her experiences with “the Mormons”, the film and the Latter-day Saints and commentators she's met during this journey over the past five years, which included visits to several Sunstone symposiums, Mormon History Association conferences, and many other LDS gatherings. You can learn more about the film series at www.pbs.org/previews/themormons.",

The film tells the story of the involvement of African Americans in the early Church, including being part of the early pioneer companies. It deals forthrightly with the priesthood and temple ban and how those issues played out during the Civil Rights Movement. It looks at the lifting of that ban and its lingering effects on today's Black Mormons. The film also includes never-released footage and many rare archival photographs, as well as interviews with renowned scholars, historians, Black Mormons, and with Martin Luther King III and Dr. Cecil 'Chip' Murray, the retired pastor of the First AME Church of Los Angeles, which was founded by a former slave of Mormon pioneers.",

In recent decades, eight other Mormons have run for the presidency, including the major candidacies of George Romney in 1968 and Morris 'Mo' Udall in 1976. And in 1844, Joseph Smith made history by being the first clergyman to run for president, as well as the first candidate to be assassinated during his campaign. In this session, Newell G. Bringhurst, co-author with Craig L.

My research illustrates that there may be little difference between a 'liberal' Mormon and an ex-Mormon in terms of knowledge of difficult historical, doctrinal, and cultural issues.

Originally, however, these were denigrations used to describe the unsophisticated country dwellers who had not yet accepted the tenets of Christianity then normative among city dwellers. This paper will suggest that 'paganism' in this sense of the term should now apply to the scriptural literalism that is still existent today and which is decidedly more common among people who dwell in rural or other less-densely-populated areas. In this context, I ask whether Mormonism might be one of the more intransigently pagan cultures in the U.S. and indeed the developed world.",

Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion, and Public Life at University of California, Santa Barbara. He is a consultant on religion and society issues for PBS, NBC, and Religion and Ethics Newsweekly and writes a column at Beliefnet.com. Dr. Roof received his B.A. in English (magna cum laude) from Wofford College, followed by an M.Div. from Yale University, and then an M.A. and Ph.D., both in sociology, from the University of North Carolina. In addition to his teaching duties at UCSB, he is the principal investigator for a Ford Foundation-funded project on religious pluralism in southern California and recently completed an academic director stint for a U.S. Department of State project, 'Religion in the United States: Pluralism and Public Presence.' Among the sixteen books he's written, edited, co-authored or co-edited, two are particularly relevant for this year's Smith-Pettit lecture topic on generational spirituality: Spiritual Marketplace: Baby Boomers and the Remaking of American Religion (Princeton University Press, 1999) and Bridging Divided Worlds: Generational Cultures in Congregations He is married to Terry Roof, a writer, educator, grief counselor, and advocate in the California juvenile court system. We all belong to a generation, whether conscious of it or not. Generations are age-based cohorts who share somewhat similar life experiences: They have grown up influenced by common national and international events; their outlook and values were shaped in their formative years by the social environments of which they were and still are a part. Religiously, there is an important impact, and often subtle. Broad social and cultural changes, especially in the role of the media and shifts in work and family patterns, all bear upon how we see ourselves and our understandings of faith, spirituality, God, and social issues important to us. In this presentation, we shall look at four generations-World War II Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation Xers, and Millennials -and profile their differing religious and spiritual views, the challenges each has or has had in making sense of their lives, and their lived expressions of faith. As we shall see, the fundamental question 'Who Am I?' turns out to be far more complex that we might have first imagined.",

Mormons do not wear crosses, and no Mormon chapel or temple is adorned with a cross. For other Christians, who see the cross as the very emblem of Christ's mission and gospel, this is a scandal and one of the reasons they consider Mormons non-Christian. This session examines the cross in Mormon scripture and history, explores the reasons for the Mormon rejection of the symbolic cross, and considers the implications of this rejection for the Church, especially in light of its wish to be considered a Christian church and to find greater common cause with other Christians.",

Theoretical frameworks developed by narratologists and anthropologists help us explore the meaning and potency of ritual in shaping our reality. Rituals, like storytelling, are also performances in space and time that evoke other worlds. When we believingly participate in rituals, the world of the sacred is invited to exist and act upon our real life. We press against the dark glass and peek behind the veil that separates the story from the storytelling and the ritual from the real.",

We each possess equal privilege to speak and share equal and reciprocal obligation to listen. This peer principle can lead to meaningful dialogue, deliberation, and ultimately to a place of mutual trust. Then, even if consensus cannot be achieved, deliberation can show us a way forward based on the discovery of common ground and the respect we have for one another. How might we Latter-day Saints do better in encouraging more openness and honesty when we engage each other? And without this type of communication, can we really gain genuine intellectual, emotional, and spiritual convictions about gospel truths?",

So, although Mormons know more about heaven than do other Christians, it's not much more than what is postulated by Islam, and not enough better to encourage suicide. Dr. Jolley's tautology fills in the gaps, creating aversion of heaven inspired by Mark Twain, Pogo, and (perhaps least of all) the prophets.",

Or are they all wrong together? Can the reported visual translation method be squared with the actual contents of the book?

Perhaps feeling the pressure of this expectation, the university places great emphasis on the standards and principles that distinguish it from other universities. The Honor Code is often cited as a document that safeguards the values of both the university and of Mormonism, but for many students, it does the opposite: it restricts or reverses their quest for authentic spirituality while punishing dissent and exploration. This panel will examine the history of the BYU Honor Code and the ways that it constructs and deconstructs mainstream Mormonism. Drawing on research about activism and dissent at BYU, the panelists will offer a critique of the Honor Code through the perspectives of students whose spiritual quest put them at odds with their religion.",

Rather than passively consuming, this generation expects to create, contribute, and critique.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the gospel it represents are not immune to these changing dynamics.

This brief introduction to the Community of Christ will focus on the basic tenets of faith and identity that characterize the current movement and highlight some of the diversity of ideas that are represented in the global church.

A Freudian Approach to The Sugar Beet Latter-day Saints are conventionally and stereotypically portrayed as inhabiting a G-rated culture that valorizes domesticity, obedience, and chastity. For this reason, and the fact that many Mormons enthusiastically embrace the stereotypes, the humor of The Sugar Beet is particularly interesting. In its treatment of issues concerning sexuality, gender, and authority, The Sugar Beet has opened or at least laid bare, another level of Mormon culture that is much more complex than that assumed in the stereotypes. But what makes Mormon humor, humorous? To explore this question, I turn to the work of Sigmund Freud who argues that jokes have two primary functions: aggression and exposure. In analyzing several jokes from The Sugar Beet, I will probe whether Freud's framework helps us to understand the underlying dynamics of Mormon humor. The presentation will be interactive, with audience members being invited at times to reflect upon what is (and is not) humorous about a particular joke.",

Yale Professor Harold Bloom, celebrated author of the book The American Religion and ardent advocate of Joseph Smith's primary place in American history, asks a critical question at the end of his provocative Sunstone essay, 'Perspectivism and Joseph Smith' (Sunstone, March 2007). In echoing Fawn Brodie's classic biography No Man Knows My History, Bloom confesses 'I believe Joseph when he says we don't know him; to me, it is the most important statement of his life.' He ends his essay with the title question: 'Did he know himself?' Since the good professor is not now available to us (we tried!), I propose to discuss his question with an emphasis on how the rising generation might respond to it. How do our youth answer such a question, not only about Brother Joseph, but about themselves? For that matter, how do the rest of us answer for ourselves?",

Yet among a small group of recovering drug addicts, the theology of Mormonism was reinvented and reinvigorated to encompass their specialized struggles. The Group started as an informal organization, partially the brainchild of Gerald and Carol Lynn Pearson, but was soon so successful that it was incorporated into local Church structure. Examining the stories, both of success and failure, within the Group is both enlightening and heartbreaking, not just for the sake of humanism but in order to observe how each generation reinvents Mormonism for its times.",

College students in particular often experience intense conflict when they encounter challenges to official church narratives. How do members deal with such conflict? Carl Jung developed a model for the growth of the psyche that he named 'individuation.' Jung asserts that the unconscious leads us to health and growth. Sometimes this is accomplished through dreams, whether we pay attention to them or not. Of course, if we attend to our dreams, we may understand signals the unconscious gives us regarding our relationship to authority systems. I present examples of dreams analyzed through Eugene Kovalenko's CREEI process. Dream analysis can be a viable method of coping with religious conflict. Part 2-Led by Eugene Kovalenko, and using the CREEI process, session attendees will have the opportunity to analyze a dream or a personal experience.",

Over the past century, as more Mormons have acquired professional training, they have applied their skills to Mormonism's foundational narratives.

It has also led to a division into two broad groups: critics and apologists. This panel will consider how Mormon historians can move beyond the critic/apologist dichotomy in order to produce faithful history that is faithful to history. How can historians begin to craft a new historical narrative that is honest and open and yet still positive and useful for average believers?",

      "Description": " Mormon Motherhood: Choice or Destiny? General Relief Society president Julie Beck caused a storm of protest among some LDS women who understood her General Conference talk as a call for them to return to, remain in, or prepare for the traditional role of motherhood. In a press conference, new Young Women president Elaine Dalton was asked about statistics indicating 80 percent of single Mormon women ages 18 to 30 are not active in the LDS Church. The reaction to Beck's talk and the inactivity of single women may be connected to changing perceptions of motherhood. To what extent is the role of mother prescribed and scripted for Mormon women? Does the Church offer other models for shaping women's identity?",

Certainty discourages inquiry. Literalism creates an atmosphere of skeptical rejection of many figurative, symbolic, or metaphorically rich possibilities-and this, in turn can lead to mistaken application of scriptural texts. Unwavering obedience to leaders (including the notion that even if leaders make mistakes, we are blessed by obeying them anyway) tends to foster an unhealthy culture of hero worship and a view of General Authorities as celebrities, resulting in our being distracted from the central figure of the Savior and sometimes promoting a mentality that leads to abuses of power.",

Why Christ Must Be the Prism through Which All War Scripture and Theology is Interpreted The two presenters are currently working on a book discussing a Christ-centric approach towards issues of war and peace in scripture and LDS theology. Throughout our tradition's existence, Latter-day Saints have selectively drawn upon war narratives from both the Bible and our own additional scripture to support and validate everything from imperial conquests, pre-emptive wars of 'self defense,' and even genocide. Contrary to the view among many that the scriptures are paradoxical and inconsistent, and therefore adaptable to essentially all U.S. declarations of war, we believe that a more critical and comprehensive reading of latter-day scripture reveals a clear, powerful, and consistent framework wherein we are invited to 'renounce war[s] and proclaim peace' (D&C 98:16). In particular, scriptural narratives about war and peace are quite clear if Christ's teachings, life, and death are allowed to serve as the prism through which they are interpreted, understood, and followed.",

Fear to speak up; fear that I'm not good enough; fear of failure; fear of being honest; fear of non-acceptance; fear of identifying and facing my fears; and fear of my shadow side. These were vague discomforting underlying fears until I saw them magnified in my performance of music. Then I became determined to overcome my fears and shadowy habits. As I have worked on the musical issues, I have become more confident in other areas of my life and have learned to speak up and say what I honestly think, no longer hiding. My music has become deeper, more expressive, and infinitely more satisfying. Integrating our shadow with our light brings about spiritual growth and a joyous discovery of self. I'll play several pieces that illustrate my development, ending with the Albinoni Adagio.",

Openly celebrated, elaborated, and contested by generations of Mormon thinkers, the doctrine has today become nearly invisible in official Church discourse. Even LDS apologists defending the doctrine have attempted to tame the bolder implications championed by earlier Mormon thinkers, including Joseph Smith.

Narratives recounting the trauma of conversion (or deconversion) can replicate the trauma, first through writing about it, then through reading about it.

      "Description": " Crisis of Faith Experiences among Faithful Mormon Intellectuals Do I still believe in God? Is the Mormon understanding of God and the universe something I can continue to embrace? Is it possible to keep my intellectual integrity and still be a deeply committed Mormon? What would happen if I abandoned my faith? A crisis of faith experience stretches one's emotional, spiritual, and intellectual resources to the limit. This presentation explores research conducted at Harvard University that tells the stories of six highly educated Mormons, all of whom traveled to the very edge of religious doubt yet ultimately chose to remain committed Mormons. These intriguing personal journeys are explored in the context of the presenter's own crisis of faith. What emerges is an interesting picture of what goes on in the minds and hearts of thoughtful Mormons as they fight to keep faith alive.",

I argue that religiosity can masquerade as a form of spirituality but ultimately betrays it. In this session, I propose four unfortunate conditions that prevail when religiosity is allowed to reign over spirituality and which I believe many in older generations remain asleep to.",

Jackson, a non-LDS visitor to Nauvoo, wrote: 'Joe Smith boasted to me that he â€¦ from the commencement of his career had seduced 400 women.' If this is true, that would mean there would be 400 victims of Smith's debauchery. Ironically, the historical record fails to identify even one woman who said she was seduced by the Prophet. An in-depth review of available historical documents reveals a total of nineteen claims accusing Joseph Smith of sexual impropriety. In this session, I evaluate these claims for believability, emphasizing the difference between rumor, assumption, and credible evidence. I present extensive research that supports the probable existence of conjugal relations between Joseph Smith and nine of his plural wives, possible existence with another six, and doubtful existence with all non-wives and 'polyandrous' wives.",

Even as President Beck was speaking, the Bloggernacle began to light up with discussion on her emphasis on mothers as nurturers and the examples she used to express her ideas. The talk evoked both strong feelings and deep contemplation, and even now, nearly a year later, it still garners discussion as LDS women and men have used it as a springboard to reflect on their personal experiences of knowing in terms of parenthood, perfection, nurturing, and scriptural interpretation. One diverse group of women used the energy of the discussion to develop a website, WhatWomenKnow.org, designed to expand the conversation about what it means to be an LDS woman. Panel members in this session will do a brief readers' theater performance that illustrates the process of the site's evolution. Then they will share their reasons for participating with WhatWomenKnow.org, their sense of both the positive and negative responses to the conversation and website, and their insights into diversity in the LDS woman's experience.",

In turn, parents and leaders can feel misunderstood as they try to express their beliefs while showing love.

Patrick Polk's presentation focuses on the life of William McCarey. Described variously as African American, Native American, Spanish, and mixed-race, McCarey is an enigmatic figure whose activities as a Mormon convert, or at least those ascribed to him, have had a powerful and lasting impact on LDS racial perceptions and church policies regarding African Americans.",

When Nephi states that his 'soul delighteth in plainness,' one must wonder just how he defined 'plainness.' So many things in the Book of Mormon and, by extension, throughout Mormonism, are far from plain. This presentation focuses on how much of Mormonism involves holding opposing thoughts and finding truth by reconciling them. Because the Book of Mormon teaches that there must needs be opposition in all things, this shouldn't be a problem within the faith.",

Most philosophical arguments for God's existence have been aimed at justifying traditional Christian theology. However, Mormon theology, particularly as advocated by Joseph Smith near the end of his life, diverges from tradition to posit emergent gods that organize worlds from existing matter according to existing laws. Aiming at justifying Mormon theology, we have formulated a new argument for God's existence. The argument is based on assumptions widely shared among both secular andreligious persons, is consistent with modern science and technological trends, and concludes that we should trust that our world probably is created by advanced life forms more benevolent than we are. We invite philosophers, theologians, scientists, technologists, and anyone interested in such matters to come with your most critical eyes and ears. We are very interested in feedback, and a good portion of this session will be devoted to questions and criticisms.",

This presentation identifies historical developments that affect how and when this debate has unfolded and applies theoretical frameworks from the sociology of knowledge to explain how identification with different groups-including, potentially, the LDS Church, other religious communities, and scholarly discourse communities-influences a person's convictions about Book of Mormon historicity. I argue that how someone assesses the evidence for and against Book of Mormon historicity is fundamentally a question of how well socialized that person is into the Church. In other words, belief or disbelief in Book of Mormon historicity has less to do with intellectual issues per se than with the quality of a person's relationships with Latter-day Saints as compared to investments in other social groups.",

The historical debate on this problem is not monolithic, yet two recent voices push the debate forward: Eugene England and Dwight Hopkins in the book, Mormonism in Dialogue with Contemporary Christian Theologies.

Proceeding from the work on human individuation by social psychologist Erich Fromm, this presentation details the development of a series of compelling, cutting-edge theories regarding the inner world of the religious apostate. It concludes with an overview of the most effective therapeutic pathways for healing internal and interpersonal religious conflict.",

Are we to assume that means all families, or just some families of a particular type? When the Proclamation warns of the 'disintegration' of family, what exactly does that mean? And what do 'responsive citizens and governments' do 'to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society?' What are we hearing from Church leaders to answer those questions and fill in the gaps? In this session, I present my take on those questions and suggest that we in the Church may be seduced by our own rhetoric about family.",

When we witness the many messages our children are receiving at church, it is natural to wonder if the positive messages outweigh the negative and if there is a way to filter or counterbalance the negative messages our children are learning and absorbing. Should we stay active in the church for the children? Or, would they be better off if we chose to leave? This panel-made up of several women who have decided to leave the Church with their children and others who have stayed-will speak about their reasons for staying or going. And those who have stayed will share what they have done to guide, instruct, and support their children or grandchildren.'",

Ash, Shaken Faith Syndrome: Strengthening One's Testimony in the Face of Criticism and Doubt, examines the underlying misconceptions that contribute to de-conversion, suggests ways Latter-day Saints can strengthen their intellectual foundations against challenging issues, and then provides an even-handed and accurate framing of several of the most popular LDS-critical arguments. How well does it succeed? Would this book be a valuable tool for you or a loved one?

The story is told from the perspective of Ethan, a college-aged, gay Mormon, who shortly after the death of his father, begins to crave intimacy with his best (and married) friend, which sets him on a somewhat desperate and impulsive soul-searching path of sexual and religious identity. In the process, Ethan reveals the complex nature of his dilemma: the integrity of his faith and his love for Mormonism (and all that its theology of eternal marriage implies), and his genuine need for human affection.",

Inspired by recent discussions among Mormon women, Becky has rededicated herself to becoming a 'wife who knows' (how to please her husband, that is) and in so doing discovered timeless wisdom from the classic treatise on the subject: Fascinating Womanhood, by Helen Andelin. And for the rising LDS generation, she has also plucked sparkling gems of wisdom about becoming a 'Beehive who wants to know' from the companion volume, Fascinating Girl.

Conversant in contemporary issues and informed about alternatives, the rising generation of Latter-day Saints is uniquely positioned to initiate positive change in the Church.

Conservative scholars downplay these contradictions by asserting that the Mormon god-concept has never changed while others argue that Joseph abandoned his earlier orthodox Trinitarianism in favor of a heterodox polytheism. Neither approach accounts for the content of Mormon authoritative texts that demonstrate that Joseph did not abandon, but rather complicated, his earlier teachings, leading to misunderstandings of his most controversial religious contributions. My paper seeks to promote for rising generations a spiritually unified interpretation that accounts for and gives equal dignity to the source texts of Joseph Smith's complex godhead doctrine.",

Called the Light of Christ (or spirit of God), this primal energy source is not only defined as the life force, the source of enlightenment, and the intelligence from which we are made, but also explains many seeming mysteries regarding grace, atonement, and judgment. It also links LDS theology to Eastern mystic notions of the source of oneness with the mind of God and with each other. Awareness of these concepts transforms the way people live their religion.

Since Joseph Smith's First Vision is both the fundamental historical event and the basic theological tenet of Mormon thought, it has been the object of many attacks on Smith's credibility. Questions are generally raised concerning the content and the timing of the event because Joseph did not report on the event until more than twelve years after it occurred. Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph's mother, added to the problem by merging the First Vision and the 1823 visitation of the Angel Moroni to the Prophet in her history, which was prepared after Joseph's death and not subject to his review. This presentation addresses the timing and content issues through a careful analysis of the sequence of events that led up to the First Vision. It demonstrates why Joseph's account is most likely accurate.",

The court's decision has drawn criticism from various quarters, including a 20 June letter from the LDS First Presidency urging California Church members to get involved in campaigning for a new ballot initiative defining marriage as only between one man and one woman. This panel will discuss several aspects of this ongoing controversy, including the legal doctrines at issue in the case, the ramifications for individuals, both inside and outside California, and the case's possible effect on other unpopular proposed marriage systems, such as plural marriage. It will also consider the Church's involvement in the context of both the earlier campaign to define marriage and this new one just getting underway.

      "Description": " Purposeful Strangers: Examining Ex-Mormon Narratives and Reasons People Give for Leaving the Church This dual-paper session looks at the issue of why people leave the Church and the paths they often take upon their exit. Seth Payne's presentation offers the results of research he has conducted on the exit narratives of so-called Mormon apostates. It places the narratives in an appropriate sociological framework and identifies common trends and structure for the narratives as a literary subgenre. Ryan Wimmer concentrates more on the directions Mormon dissenters take following their decision to leave Mormonism. Have many been able to assimilate into other faiths? Why do most modern dissenters seem to become atheistic or agnostic rather than finding another faith? Have they met in other traditions the same issues that troubled them about Mormonism?",

Affirmation leaders in this session will discuss the following questions: What are the puzzles, trials, and hopes associated with being young, gay, and Mormon? How does Affirmation help gay LDS men and women in their journey? How has the experience of being gay and Mormon evolved over the last thirty years? Is the Church re-defining its stance on homosexuality? Is there hope for a productive dialogue between Church leaders and Affirmation?",

Because it draws on documents not previously available to scholars and offers new angles on traditional sources, the book is being touted as the 'most thoroughly researched account of the massacre ever written.'

Today, many of our young people have no idea that there was a priesthood restriction. This presentation will include anecdotes and provide resources, giving cause for hope, and also cause for concern. How far have we come since 1978? What lingering challenges do we face as a new generation enters the mission field, often with little knowledge of what the restriction entailed and implied? What are our responsibilities as keepers of the memories?",

Despite the Church’s opposition to its contemporary practice, plural marriage continues to be viewed as the higher law that will be practiced in heaven. Comparing Old Testament examples of polygamy (and my experience with polygamy in Africa today) with New Testament teachings about marriage raises the question, however: Is plural marriage really a higher law after all?",

Conservative Mormons responded that in Joseph Smith's time, young teen brides were common. This paper will review the American history of family life to answer the question: what was the normal marriage age in Joseph smith's culture?

While the Community of Christ may share much of the same canon and early history with LDS Mormonism, there are important divergences regarding homosexuality. exploring commonalities and differences is useful for saints from both churches who are seeking understanding, healing, and reconciliation. in examining conceptions of Zion, I hope to contribute to individual and collective actions that are true to our common Restoration heritage and understandings of human worth.",

This prohibition abruptly ended in 1978 with the termination of the priesthood and temple ban against those of African descent. This paper traces public and private anti-miscegenation statements made by early Church leaders, including Joseph Smith–from expressions of disgust and horror bolstered by scriptural proof-texting and prophetic language to shore up its theological foundations, to 20th Century political accusations of a joint “negro” and Communist conspiracy to bring societal and moral upheaval to the United states.",

      "Presenters": "Ben Clarke",
      "Description": "Paper 1: \"A Marginal Moses: A Case Study in Canonicity, Historicity, and Revelation.\" Since its canonization in 1880, most LDS members have viewed the Book of Moses as a restoration of lost truth grounded in historical events. However, converging lines of evidence from Mormon history, the reevaluation of the Joseph smith Translation, and textual criticism of both the Hebrew Bible and restoration scriptures have undermined this assumption, creating an increasingly marginal place for the Book of Moses in the LDS canon. The need to reevaluate the paradigm used to understand the Book of Moses creates difficult questions and promising possibilities for the discussion of historicity, methodology, and canonical status for LDS leaders, scholars, and members.  Paper 2: \"The Myth of the Missing Book of Abraham Papyrus.\" The \"missing papyrus theory\" has gained ground as the most popular Book of Abraham apologetic. Defenders of this theory have exaggerated the quantity of papyrus that is missing from the present collection—and in so doing, have hindered the progress of serious historical understanding of the origins and meaning of the Book of Abraham. When eyewitness testimony and physical evidence are examined through responsible historical methodologies, we find not only that the corpus of missing papyrus is much smaller than has been claimed, but also that the ostensible source of the Book of Abraham is among the extant fragments.",

      "Description": "Mormon polygamy (sometimes called “big love”) might have roots in Hebrew writings; however, Mormon Celestial Marriage was first alluded to in the Book of Mormon and was later shared with 200 men and more than 700 women in Nauvoo, Illinois, between 1841 and 1846. at first practiced in silence because it was against Illinois law, Nauvoo polygamy was disrupted by an internal revolt which resulted in the arrest and assassination of the Mormon prophet and expulsion of the saints from Illinois. Polygamy was first announced in the salt lake valley in 1852, but was never retroactively included in the adumbrated history of Nauvoo. When the U.s. government pressured the saints to end plural marriage circa 1890, a process of institutional forgetting ensued. More than a century later, the HBO series Big Love portrays family life in modern polygamous households, while those men who pioneered the early practice of Celestial Marriage in Nauvoo are still inaccurately depicted in Church instruction manuals as having had only one wife. Come hear more about the intricate and lesser-known history of Celestial Marriage in Nauvoo",

In basic structure, the premortal romance begins before mortality and drives the lovers to find their soul mate in mortality. The moment of recognition between the premortal lovers resembles the moment of imprinting between Meyer's werewolves.

Most Mormons voted for Proposition 8 because the Prophet said it was essential to “protect traditional marriage.” I believe Mormons can protect marriage as instructed by Church leaders as well as allow for civil liberties and rights of homosexuals.

      "Presenters": "Margaret M. Toscano",
      "Description": "Without apology, Mormons proclaim their belief that both God the Father and Jesus Christ are embodied beings with separate identities. While a belief in a Heavenly Mother is also an official doctrine of the LDS Church, her nature and divine status are less clear. In addition, the introduction of a Heavenly Mother raises the troubling question of divine sexuality. How literally should we view divine embodiment? Is a female God necessary to elevate the status of women? Why has the transcendent God usually been pictured as male? Since women have traditionally been linked with the body and the earth, is it necessary to redeem the idea of embodiment itself in order to redeem women’s position? Does eternal embodiment limit eternal progression or enhance it? Is personhood possible without a gendered body?",

      "Description": "The issue of women and priesthood inevitably emerges in discussions about women’s roles in Mormonism since the priesthood is the organizing principle for everything in the LDS Church from ordinances to missionary work. If women do not have access to priesthood, can they have full equality or fully utilize their gifts in the Church? We will have panelists who represent various positions: 1) women have priesthood and should be allowed to exercise it in the Church, 2) women’s priesthood functions on a private level, 3) women don’t need priesthood to fully use their spiritual gifts in the Church, 4) motherhood for women is the equivalent of priesthood for men",

In doing this, we hope to not only delve into specific issues of Mormon feminism, but also to illustrate the variety of approaches available for future work in the area.",

      "Description": "Produced by BYU in 1969, the short film Johnny Lingo is often cited as a wise, compassionate story of male sensitivity to female identity, a positive demonstration of how to foster female self-worth. But the story hinges on the idea that a woman’s self-esteem is based on the price she commands in a financial transaction between men, not on any internal sense of who she is. This paper will present a close reading of the film, examine some implications of this financial transaction, and consider more realistic and modern ways than the barter system of encouraging female self-respect.",

In April 2008, Schleicher County, Texas authorities raided the 1700-acre YFZ Ranch and seized 439 FLDS children with almost identical justification and results. Both raids played to the same stereotypes, drove the FLDS inward, and were financial disasters for the states. Didn’t anybody read history?",

But when a questionable teaching originates from the Church’s top leaders, it becomes a larger problem. That’s because in today’s Church, we tend to treat concepts as true merely because they come from the prophet, First Presidency, or Twelve. Ere long, the dubious doctrines or teachings creep into manuals, magazines, classes, and talks, and we’re stuck with them. In this session, I will explore twelve questionable teachings that have been propounded by top Church leaders and have been widely believed. By examining them, perhaps we can magnify our capacity to detect and weed out other dubious teachings.",

Fortunately, there is a large growth industry whose mission is to provide aids for Bible study. Unfortunately, many are sectarian and intend to persuade rather than to enlighten.

What will be proclaimed is a word about and through the main character, Tamar, David's daughter who is raped by her brother Amnon.In this powerful text, many of the controlling issues of patriarchy and the subjection of women, which severely limit the options women can exercise, are exposed. The implications of this text for women in church and culture are immense.

This paper will compare the 2006 CHI with its 1999 counterpart, especially modifications and changes. It will also explore the larger context of hierarch and member in which, presumably, most of the active roles are assigned to the hierarch and most of the passive roles to the member.

      "Presenters": "Kevin Cantera",
      "Description": "In 1894, John Hyrum Koyle began digging the Dream Mine on a mountaintop in central Utah. Koyle, who was a Mormon bishop at the time, claimed he had been shown where to dig by Moroni, the same heavenly messenger who had led Mormon founder Joseph Smith to unearth the golden plates. Moroni visited Koyle in a dream and showed him nine enormous caverns inside the mountain containing countless piles of gold. Moroni told Koyle that the gold would remain hidden in the caves until an unspecified time preceding the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. At that moment of chaos, Koyle and his followers would unearth the gold and it would support the financially-troubled LDS Church through the Last Days. This paper investigates the nature of belief in the Dream Mine, which remains fervent more than one hundred years later. Although shareholders’ dreams are perpetually deferred, believers tap into a rich vein of folklore that runs through Mormon cosmology. This presentation will consider how Dream Mine belief has evolved in a changing economic, political, and religious landscape and demonstrate that the faithful find sustenance in the Mormon past while simultaneously embracing modern worldviews that extend beyond mainstream Mormonism.",

      "Description": "I embarked on my own Mormon pilgrimage in an effort to understand religious declarations of faith as expressed in Church historical sites, particularly in Vermont, New York, and Missouri. First, I will examine how, in their attempt to restore Mormon historical sites, the LDS Church creates simulacra, sites where the representations have only a tangential relationship to reality. However, despite the “constructedness” of these historical restorations, these fabrications have real effects. Second, I also discuss how the tours construct testimony, especially evident in their three-step presentations that move from historical context, to didactic moral lesson, to spiritual declarations.",

The prophet was uncomfortable with public speaking while the Baptist was a seasoned orator and the leader of the largest group of converts. Sidney was named Joseph’s spokesman at their first meeting. What attracted him to the new movement? What qualified him to become the public face of Mormonism so early? And years before the Spalding theory of the Book of Mormon origins was advanced, why did Baptists suspect Rigdon of being the real founder of Mormonism? (The Spalding theory itself is not discussed in this paper.)",

      "Description": "In April 1984, RLDS Church President Dr. Wallace B. Smith presented to the church’s World Conference a proposed revelation which, among other things, called for the church to begin ordaining women. The issue had been festering in the church for at least fifteen years and was very controversial. Approximately twenty percent of the delegates voted against the motion to accept the document as a revelation to be included in the Doctrine and Covenants, and approximately the same percentage of active members ceased their involvement in the church as a result. It was a watershed moment in the history of the RLDS Church (since 2001 the Community of Christ), and the church today is in some ways difficult to recognize compared to the church that existed a generation ago. Robin K. LinkhartCommunity of Christ’s Section 156 was canonized in 1984. This paper will explore traditional Christian patriarchal hierarchy, Latter Day Saint organizational culture, and the journey of women breaking new ground as ordained ministers in the Community of Christ.

In my paper, part of Sunstone’s Mapping Mormon Issues project, I’ll explore this controversy—its origin, unfolding, and future. I’ll point out where the attempted explanations have succeeded and where they have failed, identify overlooked evidence, and offer new perspective on the debate and the meaning of these foundational experiences.",

General Joseph Smith Jr. Militarism also appears to be correlated with patriarchy and in Nauvoo included both the beginning of polygamy and resistance to it by women led by Emma Smith through the Women’s Relief Society. This paper argues that, perhaps influenced more by his mother Emma than his father, Joseph III laid the foundations in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS) of a possible peace church as he and others reacted against the militarism and polygamy of Nauvoo.

The resulting imbalance leads away from perfection and a wholeness. There exists a spiritual imperative to embrace the soul mate of the self, the marriage, and the Divine. In each developmental union, the feminine and masculine energies are balanced, the ego is displaced, and the shadow is owned instead of blamed on others. Otherwise, we remain a house divided, fragmented, and disconnected. The resulting dysfunction is manifested on all levels of our lives: personally, relationally, spiritually, and institutionally.",

In this paper, I will analyze revelatory dreams as discussed by general authorities since 1971. My analysis will suggest that dreams are still considered revelatory and used in the context of telling faith-promoting stories—but with a difference: While leaders once were eager to share with the church their most personal intimations, more recent leaders have retreated to a less charismatic mode, preferring to retell famous dreams from the past rather than sharing their own.",

Her immediate and somewhat indignant response was: “It means the men are in charge!” LDS theology describes gender-specific roles that some observers claim place women beneath men in importance or value. Do core doctrines taught by Joseph Smith and other modern prophets truly support this assessment? Do these gender-specific roles continue after mortal death and into eternity? Do exalted women feel inferior to exalted men? Is polygamy demeaning to women or a benefit available only to females, a benefit that comprises a minor component of the eternal patriarchal order? While there is much that we do not know, the scriptures and modern prophets have provided important hints.",

We'll review Sonia's outspoken support of the ERA, how it led to her excommunication, and explore whether she had lasting influence on women in the Church—or on the Church itself. We'll also discuss whether there are differences between Mormon feminists today and 1970s activists and whether Church rhetoric about women has shifted in the 30 years since Sonia made headlines.",

There has been a tremendous democratization of the publishing process almost across the board, which is exciting news for most authors. But in Mormonism, the consolidation of Deseret Book’s reach into both publishing and retail has actually put the squeeze on independent authors and publishers. What does the new “85/15” mix (the idea that 85% of the product in Deseret stores needs to be from Deseret Book) mean for independent publishers and authors? If it’s harder than ever to get distribution in Deseret’s retail stores, what other avenues are available for authors and publishers? What’s the next frontier in Mormon publishing?",

From the start, Mormonism has been a “Romantic” religion: the Adam and Eve narrative took center stage with Joseph Smith introducing three new versions of the narrative; like their literary cousins, these sacred texts took a radically Gnostic turn. Knowledge is a boon rather than a curse; the fall is fortunate rather than fatal; and Eve is a hero rather than a pariah. In this paper, I will begin to situate Joseph Smith's retellings of the Adam and Eve narrative within nineteenth-century poetic production and look at issues of gender, theology, and American identity.",

Sadly, this ordinance and the teachings surrounding it remain centered on the eternal relationship of a man and a woman—when the highest expression of the oneness of male and female is found in Knowing God as Jesus knew him. Through his parable of The Ten Virgins, Jesus invites all of us, both male and female, to become his brides through a wonderful spiritual seduction and into an intimate relationship in which we can “know as we are known.",

      "Description": "Conflict within religions is often far more potentially damaging than disagreements between them. At the heart of intra-religious conflict is the feeling of betrayal. The heretic is a member of the family who has chosen to destroy the family from within. This treachery is personal. But it feels different for the heretic, who feels she is “believing more” than the group is and wants to elevate it to a higher vision than it has for itself. The first part of this session, presented in the voices of the “faithful” Mormon member and the “heretic” will unpack the complex, painful heart of this type of conflict. In the second part, experienced voice-dialogue facilitator John Kesler will lead session attendees in an experiential process that will take them deeply into the personal dynamics of heresy.",

What insights can be gained from a history that shifts its focus to people and places more familiar: our homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces? Julie Hemming Savage, author of Women Making America, will share her insights into the relevance of women’s history and its power to enliven our lives and feed our souls by allowing us to see our families and ourselves as the creators of history.",

      "Description": "Mormon mom and BYU grad Stephenie Meyer created a myth so compelling, her Twilight series sold 42 million books worldwide and migrated to the movie screen and grossed $188 million. As the bestselling fiction author of 2008, Meyer is the biggest publishing phenomenon since J.K. Rowling. She has sold more books than any Mormon author except Joseph Smith and is the most commercially successful Mormon writer since Orson Scott Card and Stephen R. Covey. Her vision of ethical vampires is violent and redemptive, addictive and satiating, prosaic and provocative, with hints of deeper meaning buried in a narrative of teen angst. What is the magic in her myth that captivates so many readers? Is her netherworld a dreamscape others long to inhabit? Does Mormonism shape her work? How do religious themes or ideas emerge in her work? What do her books say about her and her readers?",

Several from outside the polygamous culture have made a special effort to learn about the polygamous lifestyle and to see that services are available to plural families if warranted. Two people from each of these perspectives will discuss their recent, interesting, mostly behind-the-scenes, activities in serving polygamous families.",

After reviewing the context of the Mormon deathbed, this paper describes the creation and history of Latter-day Saint rituals for the dying and their evolution in Mormon liturgy to the present.",

The object of this paper is to demonstrate the insufficiency of even the best of the existing models, such as the “strata” model offered by Jan Shipps, and to propose a model that makes use of her insights, agrees with the earliest evidence, and accounts for Mormonism’s distinctively Judaic brand of Christianity.",

Thus, the “living word” of revelation and the “dead letter” of sacred scripture constitute two poles that stand diametrically opposed. However, history has provided us with two communities that successfully bridged the perceived chasm between extra-textual revelation and written scripture. This paper will examine the approaches of the Qumran community and the Mormon prophet Joseph smith regarding revelation and its embodiment in scripture.",

His daily radio program has 6.5 million listeners his Fox television program has 3 million viewers and his website, glennbeck.com, reaches more than one million monthly visitors. to the general populous and among Mormons, Beck is a controversial figure, with some Mormons seeing him as a paragon of their religious values and others seeing him as the antithesis of those same values.

But to what degree would contemporary Bible-based Christians recognize Mormon as a prophetic figure? And would today's Latter-day Saints recognize Mormon as a prophetic leader when his writings differ from today's understanding of certain doctrinal points? Using the Bible and literature unique to the LDS Church, this paper will examine eight dimensions of these important questions.

Now dissenters and fearful of their lives, he and his extended family left Utah under the protection of an army escort and went to California. McAuslan never lost his regard for the Mormon people it was the leaders, he believed, who had not followed the highest precepts of their religion.

      "Description": "\"The Great Spirit Has Told Us That You Are the Man\": American Indian Delegations to Joseph Smith at Nauvoo, Christopher C. Smith Joseph Smith as a Spiritual Egalitarian, Bryan Cottle Smith: In 1843 and 1844, several anti-American, formerly British-allied Indian groups dispatched delegations to Joseph Smith at Nauvoo. They apparently came to Smith because the exit of the British and the fall of the Shawnee prophet Tenskwatawa had left a political and religious power vacuum that they hoped Smith and his Nauvoo legion could fill. They hoped that Smith would replace the British king as their white patron and military ally and Tenskwatawa as their apocalyptic warrior-prophet. If smith had said \"yes\" to these Indian overtures, then in one fell swoop, he might have inherited the remains of Britain's and Tenskwatawa's Indian empire. He seems, however, to have turned them down, or at least to have deferred his acquiescence for public relations reasons. Cottle: Early in life, Joseph Smith experienced spiritual manifestations. For the rest of his days, he constantly urged his followers to experience the supernatural as he did. This trend reveals Joseph Smith as a \"spiritual egalitarian.\" Smith also embedded his spiritual egalitarianism in the structure and teachings of his movement. Although, it can be argued, this egalitarian impulse diminished after Smith’s death in 1844, its impact upon Mormonism was profound and gives us greater insight into smith’s personality.",

Are these films indicative of a spiritual renaissance in society, or are they in part an outgrowth of the spiritual lives and values of the people making them? Recent films such as The Blind Side and The Book of Eli have portrayed religious characters with depth and respect, rather than making them a curiosity or punch line. Films about religious themes and spiritual journeys can be fascinating—if the project is in the right hands. What’s needed to make a spiritually-themed film a great film, too? What makes films with spiritual themes rise above preachiness and treacle? Can filmmakers, producers, actors, and other industry players translate personal spiritual values into the film projects they undertake? Mormon cinema has been trying to reach out to a larger audience—with mixed success. What lessons can Mormons in the entertainment industry learn from their peers who take on the challenge of making high-quality spiritual films?",

The paper tells the story of this plan’s origins, its sometimes bizarre development, and its quiet, mysterious abandonment. The paper provides a context for understanding the Pacific Coast implications, the war’s other unintended consequences, and the underlying premise that the war was not just a Utah phenomenon, but rather was a sprawling conflict with regional (Western) and even international sweep that included a significant and colorful California story.",

Often people accomplish this by adopting or co-opting existing expressions, trying them on for size, and changing them as the prevailing fashions of thought and expression rotate. LDS doctrine emphasizes the development of individual efforts to seek a relationship with God and all things divine. As a result of the cultural strength of individual discipleship in the Mormon experience, standardized expressions may not satisfy. Sooner or later, all individuals must develop their own personal iconography for expressing their experience. This presentation and exhibit represents a few elements of inner dialogue that i have attempted to give expression in the form of visual art.",

Contemporary literary theory even reminds us that the citation is inevitable, for “grafting” another text is inherent in any use of language. Given how often LDS authors quote other writers, I explore the effect of these literary borrowings in an LDS context, examining how citing another’s text generates, expands, and multiplies meaning as well as distorts, limits, and re-interprets the original source text.",

Mormon scripture—the Book of Moses and the Doctrine and Covenants—transforms the War into a conflict of ideas about salvation: Satan attempting to prohibit agency and guarantee universal salvation; Christ allowing choice but providing atonement for sin. In Mormon thought, the War in Heaven has been used to convey moral messages about the correct use of agency, to tie Church history to future prophetic events of cosmic history, and, most interesting, to convey an allegory about the origins of inequality and the proper role of government. Significantly, this narrative of premortal ideological confrontation also becomes a tool for earthly, political debate.",

      "Description": "Bella’s body is what propels the action of the Twilight series. The lust (for both sex and violence) it arouses, the lust it feels, the way pain makes her feel alive and close to Edward and is therefore enjoyed, the human fragility she must overcome, the bloodlust she feels as a vampire–these elements of physicality drive the story. But just as the saga avoids explicit discussions of sex despite an emphasis on erotic desire, it also avoids explicit discussions of what physicality means. Bella’s ways of inhabiting and relating to her body reveal much about her character and about the cultures–both Mormon and western–that produced her. What do they tell us about a spiritual self?",

      "Description": "This discussion brings together scholars and thinkers to discuss two books: Gary Topping's Leonard J. Arrington: A Historian's Life and Polly Aird’s book about Peter McAuslan entitled Mormon Convert, Mormon Defector: A Scottish Immigrant in the American West, 1848-1861. Through the publication of his groundbreaking Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints and numerous other works, Leonard Arrington established the dominant interpretation of the Mormon experience. Yet until now, there has been little analysis of his contribution to Western history. Gary Topping re-examines Arrington’s role in founding and promoting what is known as the New Mormon History. Arrington has been criticized for relying on the assistance of staff members in the Church’s history division, but Topping shows that this collaborative approach is in keeping with the cooperative spirit of Mormonism. Polly Aird’s biography describes Peter McAuslan’s conversion to Mormonism in 1848 and journey to Utah in 1854. In the next four years, the Mormons experienced natural disasters, the Mormon Reformation, the handcart disasters, the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and the Utah War. These events and the insistence on absolute obedience to Church leaders tore at McAuslan's faith. In 1859, he and other members of his extended family applied for an army escort out of Utah. In spite of abandoning the faith he once loved, McAuslan never lost his regard for the Mormon people.",

By using a positive, non-blaming and non-critical approach, we can learn from your experiences and better cope ourselves.

He claimed to be acting under angelic direction and produced a new scripture, the Book of Jeraneck, to usher in his new faith. Gill claims to have restored the Mormon movement which Joseph Smith founded as a restoration of the church Jesus organized but which Gill claims has fallen into apostasy– particularly its primary iteration, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), which Gill was raised in but abandoned. This paper points out ways Gill draws upon the Mormon tradition to claim authority for his new church but also the ways he seeks to alter the balance between the LDS Church and the culture around it. In particular, I explore Gill's founding narrative, comparing the language, motifs, and forms of spirituality in the Book of Jeraneck with Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon.",

Through these case studies, the presenters will demonstrate the diverse schismatic response to well-documented theological and cultural change within the LDS Church. Unlike Mormon Fundamentalism, (e.g. the FLDS Church, the Apostolic United Brethren), these two movements have rarely been studied by modern academics. The Order of Aaron, the subject of the first paper, has not received scholarly attention since Hans Baer’s Recreating Utopia in the Desert in 1968. The subject of papers two and three, the Church of the Firstborn, has never been the focus of an academic study. This panel takes the audience through the rise, development, and disintegration of these religious communities, and each speaker will address why one expression of the Restoration may survive and thrive while others last only a few years.",

They are of value, the document tells us, because they “actually happened,” and not for any “symbolic” value.

Tied into Book of Mormon revelations declaring this land “choice above all other lands” (Ether 2:9–10), these ideas integrated religious past with prophetic future, uniting sacred time with sacred space and bringing the natural world into a cosmic order.

This panel explores the maturing of Mormonism toward the ideals of a Zion community through examinations of fragility and strength, challenges to the ability of some members to act as free agents, and our tradition’s history of reflection on disability.",

Divorce, addiction, abuse, disability–they happen to the best of us no matter how righteous we are, and many of us feel the impulse to hide tragedy in our lives. While it can be terrifying to open up about heartbreaks and disappointments, there are surprising benefits, both for those who share and those who listen. Join a panel of bloggers as they discuss why they share and what the results have been.",

What challenges and supports have they encountered at home, in church, and in the larger world? What changes have they gone through in a role that few of their male contemporaries will ever experience?",

Is it reasonable that God would give fallible human leaders the power to separate people from him or their families in eternity?

In response, Madson outlines a framework for analyzing when, if ever, war is justified, suggesting that the Book of Mormon not only allows for but strongly promotes pacifism. Van Wagenen outlines evidence that the Book of Mormon does allow for war, but only under well-prescribed conditions, namely in self-defense against aggressors or in rebellion against a government/ruler that requires its subjects to engage in acts of aggression. Both authors contend that the Afghanistan war does not meet the requirements of either a pacifist or defensive war and therefore should not be supported",

      "Description": "In 1838 Missouri, certain Mormons organized in a secret paramilitary organization called the Danites, led by Sampson Avard, who later left the Church. Many Mormons then disavowed the Danite movement, portraying it as lies concocted by Avard. When Leland Gentry wrote his groundbreaking 1965 thesis about the 1838 Mormon War, however, he reported that irrefutable evidence showed loyal Mormons had been involved in the group. One crucial issue at stake is the question of whether Joseph Smith was involved in the Danite movement. He certainly attended Danite meetings and possibly knew Danite passwords, though the evidence for this from Luman Shurtliff’s diary is ambiguous.",

      "Description": "In the modern world, humans are often conceived of as biological automatons, or in religious contexts as dependent, derivative, contingent beings utterly dependent on a necessary God. Both Nietzsche and Mormonism have strong replies to these limitations and exalt the potential for human growth. By comparing and contrasting Nietzsche’s concept of the will to power and Mormonism’s exaltation, we gain insight into the nature of power and its relation to individuals. While Nietzsche emphasizes the unbounded individual, Mormonism argues the greatest human potential is cultivated by persons bonded through covenant to God and family.",

      "Description": "The work of political economist Albert Hirschman suggests a nuanced approach to public dissatisfaction with an organization. Dissatisfied members of an organization, business, or nation have a variety of choices available, including both exit (simply leaving) and voice (discussing their dissatisfaction). As Hirschman notes, greater loyalty to the organization can correspond to greater use of voice. Contradicting traditional Mormon views, dissent may actually indicate greater loyalty to the organization than does silent acquiescence. Panelists will discuss loyalty, voice, exit, and dissent from a variety of angles, ultimately suggesting that the LDS understanding of public disagreement may be underdeveloped, and sketching ways in which legitimate dissent could take on a broader role in the LDS community.",

Hear speakers share the events and concepts that animate their religious lives: a little soul-baring, a little spiritual journey, a little intellectual testimony-bearing. This self-reflective night is about the things that matter most, plus spirited congregational hymn-singing. Eric Samuelsen is a playwright, a theatre director and historian, and a teacher. He joined the BYU faculty in 1992 after earning a PhD at Indiana University. Several of his plays have been published in Sunstone including Gadianton, Accommodations, Family, Peculiarities, and The Plan. Eric is a former president of the Association for Mormon Letters and has published in Sunstone, BYU Studies, and Dialogue. His play Amerigo was recently performed at Plan B Theatre Company in Salt Lake City, and his play Borderlands will be produced there next season. He's also adjunct religion faculty at BYU, teaching the Doctrine and Covenants. He is married and has four children. Tracy McKay is raising her three children as a single mama in Washington state, but she misses her native California coast with a palpable ache. Tracy is currently finishing her BAE in education and starting an MA in special education; in another life, she had a career as a professional artist, world traveler, and Germanophile. Tracy loves thrift stores, old books, wooden toys, crisp linen, grapefruit, and her Macbook. She writes for ByCommonConsent.com. Her personal blog is dandelionmama.wordpress.com.",

      "Description": "”In the Olden Days before Blogs: A Message to Maggie.” This paper will explore some of the developments in dissent over the past two decades, including what constituted dissent then and now. Is dissent praying privately to Mother in Heaven? Is it not putting up a lawn sign supporting Prop 8? Is it splitting your Boy Scout donation so that the Young Women get half? What role has dissent played in the Church in the last 20 years? Has it been good for the Church? Good for dissenters? Two bookends for this discussion will be the speculative theology represented by Strangers in Paradox, published 20 years ago, and the Gospel Essentials manual, now curriculum for Relief Societies and Melchizedek Priesthood quorums. “Defecting in Place.” I remain active in my ward while defining my beliefs differently from most orthodox LDS Church members. I have adopted the stance of “defecting in place,” or dissenting while staying. Based on my most recent temple recommend interview, I examine some of the areas of tension, shared expectations, and teaching/learning moments that move the experience from hostile interrogation, ritual compliance, or personal soul-searching into community-building between leader and member. In a setting where the handbook assumes that one person has all the questions and the other person has all the answers, what happens to areas of dissent? I share some approaches I have taken over a lifetime of Church activity.",

The identity of the denomination was based on “right belief this approach changed very little over the first century of the Reorganization (1850s to 1950s). I show why the Community of Christ no longer concerns itself with concepts of “only,” “legitimate,” or “true.” Seeing God’s power active in all places, with all people, at all times, the denomination now identifies with discipleship as a way of life modeled on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.

But does online feminism translate into change in the real world? What strides have we made, and how far do we still have to go?

Rick Phillips’ paper combines several data sources to show how recent shifts in Utah’s demography may have important implications for the activity and retention of Latter-day Saints in their Great Basin stronghold. “Comparing the Global Growth and Distributions of Mormons, adventists, and Witnesses, and Testing the Reliability of the Membership Data.” Mormons, Adventists, and Witnesses are all American religious groups whose beginnings date from the nineteenth century; they have all experienced strong growth and become global in scope. Much can be learned from comparing them. This presentation will begin by using the detailed membership data of the three groups to compare their growth and geographic distribution over time. It will then turn to census and other data to test to what extent their official statistics can be relied on and to make new estimates of their total active membership. Along the way, it will also consider the socioeconomic status of their members.",

Beginning with the premise that the memoirist/ personal essayist is an artist attempting to find the essential “core within the core” of his or her own humanness, the panel will explore the subject of “truth-telling” in its various incarnations—both public and private—and the individual experience of its panelists.",

      "Description": "”Toeing the Line: Is the LDS Church a Moral Agent or a Political Machine?” The LDS Church identifies its involvement in same-sex marriage issues as a moral cooperative with other religions. Yet participation by both members and general leaders appears to have outweighed participation by other religious adherents. Has the Church crossed the line from moral organizer to political action committee? Is there a difference between the two? Let's examine the evidence from 50 years of trials, proclamations, memos, experiences, and hearings—and figure out which side of the line we're on. “Mobilizing For Marriage: Congregations and Arizona’s Proposition 102.” On 4 November 2008, Arizona citizens passed Proposition 102. This proposition—known by its supporters as the Marriage Protection Amendment—amended the Arizona state constitution to define marriage as a relationship only between one man and one woman. Drawing on the Southern Arizona Congregations Study (a representative survey of 297 congregations in southern Arizona collected in 2009), I present findings related to congregation-based support of and opposition to Proposition 102 and discuss the peculiarity of Mormon participation in relation to that of other faiths. Mormon congregations were by far the most likely to get involved and participate at high levels of political mobilization in support of the proposition. I conclude with a discussion of social implications of these findings.",

      "Description": "”The Relevance of Tolstoyans for Contemporary Latter-day Saints.” Tolstoyans adhered to Russian literary genius Leo Tolstoy’s philosophy of truth and brotherly love based on complete non-violence, vegetarianism, communal living, and a code of ethics that included abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and foul language. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Tolstoyans are similar in that both groups have histories of oppression, resilience, and a love for peace, music, and community. “The Mormon Mother and Subsistence Eco-feminism” For many women, the tension between Mormonism and feminism feels like a battle between a paycheck and a family: feminists tell us to take our place as equals with men while Mormon leaders instruct us to be wives and mothers, contending that ‘career women’ lead unfulfilling lives, repress their ability to nurture and overlook meaningful relationships. I believe Mormonism’s emphasis on traditional women's roles is useful in a radical critique of patriarchy. A true focus on maternal nurturing demands rejection of exploitative capitalism, warfare, environmental destruction, and obedience to male, high-status leaders. “Kinship Structures.” The tradition of universal kinship in Mormon thought constitutes a powerful and relatively untapped form of transnational Alternative Civil Society that can resist state efforts to separate us by ethnicity, class, or nationality. This is not automatic: it requires a re-shaping and an elaboration (a “magnification”) of Mormon doctrines of genealogy, universal divine descent, and fundamental human equality. Though genealogy might suggest an exclusivity of family ties, understanding it in the context of Mormon doctrines of universal siblinghood provides a useful and flexible toolbox of concepts for egalitarian revolution. “Plotino Constantino Rhodakanaty and the beginnings of Mexican Mormonism.” Little is known about Dr. Plotino Constantino Rhodakanaty’s early years and virtually nothing of his life after 14 May 1886 when he vanished. However, his influence in the Mexican socialist and anarchist tradition and his influence in bringing the restored gospel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to Mexico are of great interest to many. This paper discusses Rhodakanaty’s marriage and his son, Nefi, as well as his relationship with Meltion Gonzalez Trejo, John Taylor, and L. A. Bertand in Paris, France, and what might have happened to Rhodakanaty after 1886.",

      "Description": "In Matthew 23 and Luke 11, Jesus lambasted the religious leaders of his day for blatant hypocrisy and a style of spiritual leadership that took away “the key of knowledge” and “shut up the kingdom of heaven against men.” According to Jesus, not only did this prevent the leaders themselves from entering the kingdom but it also “hindered” those who were close to entering! Although I don’t believe the modern LDS Church is guilty of the egregious hypocrisy detailed by Jesus, I am concerned it has established a similar system of status and worthiness along with external religious practices that can impede Latter-day Saints from the spiritual understandings and disciplines that lead to spiritual rebirth and open the kingdom of heaven. This presentation explores whether modern LDS culture and religious practices reflect the spiritual leadership that Jesus embodied or the leadership of those he criticized for hindering.",

Adding to two extant versions, the new copy included handwritten modifications, providing essentially four versions of this revelation for analysis.

      "Description": "Twenty years ago, Margaret and Paul Toscano published Strangers in Paradox: Explorations in Mormon Theology. Fascinated by the richness of Mormon texts and ritual, they had been working out a complex theology for twenty years and were eager to share their insights. The book immediately became a feminist sensation and an official scandal, resulting—at least indirectly—in the authors' excommunications in 1993 and 2000. On the anniversary of its publication, it seems appropriate to take a retrospective and prospective look at Strangers in Paradox. They will explore: What contributions does this book make to Mormon theology? Does its unifying theme of paradox illuminate and unify disparate aspects of Mormon thought? How effective is its rhetorical stance and style in conveying its meaning? How has it been received? What influence will it have in the future?",

      "Description": "Recent decades have witnessed a rising interest in what has been dubbed “narrative theology.” The Christian message, many theologians have pointed out, is not an argument but a story, and stories instead of propositional truth claims rest at the heart of the tradition. An engagement with these narratives has the potential to transform not only the way we see the world but our very identity. This panel will look at the power of such stories as seen in the interplay between our personal life narratives and those of our religious traditions.",

The interviews are conducted by Mormon Studies students and by women of the community. Interviewees have been chosen by group and individual nominations. Tonight’s lively reader’s theater-style presentations are the result of analyzing information on specific subjects from different women’s interviews, from women’s attitudes about fertility to education in Mormon culture, to defining relationships during dating, marriage, and singlehood, and how women navigate in a patriarchal church.",

During the past half-century, an important shift occurred in the study of history. Influenced by the Civil Rights and the Women’s Liberation movements, scholars moved beyond simply studying the written documents of the educated and famous. Within religious history, the focus of research became the practices of the people rather than the ideas of the elite. In order to get at this \"underside of history,\" scholars looked beyond the written word to the world of things and spaces. Material culture studies evolved to pull information out of objects, art, landscapes, and architecture. How does an ordinary object become holy, sacred, special? What are some of the ways that Christians have manipulated the material world to create and maintain their spiritual visions? How does material culture function within religious communities? Why are Americans, in particular, wedded to the physical expressions of their faith? This lecture will provide a theoretical foundation for addressing Mormon religious practices by using material culture.",

This presentation will explore the way our experiences are mediated by images and texts, including synopses at the beginning of scripture chapters, images in Ensign articles, placards next to Church art displays, and information kiosks at Church historical sites and monuments.",

What about the sisters when I offer to “divide my gifts from thee with every brother that I see who has the need of help from me?” Is the male generic still intended to include every human being? Was “he” ever intended as inclusive?

The New Spirituality is the current generalized spiritual milieu in the United States: dynamic, competitive, flexible, and hybrid—an inclusive category that can cover the wide range of non-institutional options available to Americans for spiritual self-expression as well as innovative theological trends in institutional religions. It can represent what Americans once considered New Age practices and ideas such as astrology, reincarnation, channeling, and divination (the belief in and use of which are diffuse in American culture).

Surprisingly, Mormonism exhibits some strong elements of what people might consider “ancestor worship.” From an anthropological point of view, I will explore how Mormonism challenges our traditional notions of both kinship and ancestral worship; I will also consider important ethical implications. Blurring the definition of kinship and expanding the view of ancestors by imagining all people as our brothers and sisters can help shape ethical codes by creating a level of responsibility and respect between those we don’t even know. It’s difficult to shirk responsibility and ignore other people’s needs, whether dead or alive, if we imagine them as our own siblings.",

It’s a strange belief now, but in the 1880s...it was plausible. However, as sciences advanced, Koresh’s hollow world began to implode.

Otto Fetting, Thomas B. Nerren, and William A. Draves each claimed and produced messages reportedly given by a resurrected John the Baptist. None claimed to be “a prophet,” nor did their respective church organizations institutionalize a person or office of “prophet.” However, each functioned in the prophetic role, and with the death of each, the messages ceased and the original church groups foundered. Latter Day Saint church groups that have prospered, on the other hand, tended to focus on the prophetic office, as distinct from the person and any reported messages, often institutionalizing the “prophet” as both spiritual and administrative leader. As both artifact and material culture, “prophet” is an essential ingredient of the Latter Day Saint movement and is central to the community of the church.",

These physical reflections of religious identity are important to Mormons, who routinely display various images and objects in multiple locations in their homes. With an emphasis on altars, this paper looks at the hybrid material products Latter-day Saints create when they integrate Mormonism with New Age and Pagan elements of the New Spirituality.",

However, it is a mistake to equate all democratic religion with populist religion, as Hatch does. Dissenters from the Mormons and Methodists used the populists’ own democratic rhetoric against them, even though they tended to be respectable bourgeois liberals instead of the down-on-their-luck populists Hatch atalogues. The bourgeois dissenters and Hatch's rough-and-ready populists were equally committed to democracy, but the two groups interpreted it differently. For the liberal dissenters, democracy meant total freedom of individual action, whereas for the classically republican populists, it meant freedom from injustice.",

Experiences of wonder spark both intense religious experiences and profound relationship connections. in both arenas—the intimately spiritual and the intimately social—when we are stunned, dazed, breathtaken, overwhelmed, consumed, or astonished, we feel yearnings to explore, to understand, to receive. What we receive (while wondering) will exceed the boundaries of our previous understanding, stimulating creative patterns of connection to God, loved ones, and the world. This session will explore the ways we often pursue stability at the expense of wonder, closing ourselves off to God and to each other. it will also invite us to remain open to the sparks of wonder in intimate relationships, our relationship with religion, and our relationship with God.",

The gift appears again in the Book of Mormon. It should be no surprise that when Joseph Smith proclaimed the estoration of the primitive church, expectations for the estored gift were soon followed by rumors of its appearance and later outright manifestations. This paper considers the phenomenon of raising the dead in the larger context of the antebellum Protestant debate about the possibility of miracles; it will consider reports in early Mormonism and explore ways that Mormon experience, doctrine, and authority have explained the phenomenon, using it to illuminate changing Mormon understandings of the nature of the miracle itself.",

However, those who knew Gene would add a caveat that however inspiring or troubling his words, he was even more interesting and difficult to know. Whatever Eugene England's legacy and influence on Mormons and Mormonism, his influence—on the people who knew him—was greater. \"Searching for Gene England\" is a personal essay about how he troubled, tested, influenced, and inspired one Mormon to love him.",

Michael Quinn, Michael Marquardt, and George D. Smith regarding controversial issues in Joseph Smith's polygamy such as: Whether he was married to Fanny alger in Kirtland? Whether any of his plural marriages were \"eternity\" only? Whether sexual relations occurred in his polygamous relationships including his sealings to two fourteen-year-old wives? Whether he had any children by his plural wives?",

The evidence is robust and based upon a hierarchical pattern of evidence beginning with scriptural prophecies and promises, followed by statements of Joseph Smith, geographic passages, and evidence from modern-day archeology, anthropology, linguistics, climatology, cultural and social patterns, oceanic currents, artifacts, metallurgy, building practices and materials, DNA findings, Native American oral histories and legends, animal migrations, and human population movements.",

Six months later, our family learned that our oldest son is gay. This sent us on a journey to understand the complexity of homosexuality. “Insights toward Understanding Homosexuality” focuses on six key topics: 1) Same Gender Attraction is Not a Choice; 2) It’s Not Just about Sex; 3) Scriptural Interpretation Must Account for Cultural Influences; 4) Like Us, Our Leaders Are Human; 5) Gay Marriage is Not a Threat to Traditional Families; 6) Understanding Mental Health Aspects.",

      "Description": "In When Souls Had Wings: Premortal Existence in Western Thought, Terryl Givens covers the heterodox doctrine of a pre-mortal existence from Plato to today. This idea in Platonic philosophy and its emphasis in Christian Platonism always accompanies a story of a fall from perfect unity in the ideal and a return to the same unity at the end of time. But Givens doesn’t see that for nineteenth-century Romantics and Idealists, this cycle of alienation and return assumes an even more dramatic character as the alienation of the individual from the absolute and her eventual return is the creation of a new and greater unity than the original; thus the final unity is also a plurality of persons. Early and nineteenth-century Mormonism added another twist: the final unity occurs repeatedly and the plurality of God(s) is a constant feature of the story",

These architecturally reinforced prejudices frequently lead to practical problems for Primary and young Women leaders. We will discuss alternatives to chapel design that may solve these problems.

He gleaned from the best philosophical and religious thinkers of his day a new way to think about major issues and a strategy for dealing with not only racial oppression but other issues as well; thus, we should make much more use of his thinking in church life today",

Similar strong traditions exist in many other Christian churches as well as in Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism.

      "Presenters": "Colleen McDannell, Dale E. Luffman, D. Michael Quinn, Michael G. Reed, Allen Roberts",
      "Description": "A supremely important artifact to early Christians was the cross; slivers of it were cherished as the most valuable of relics. Over time, the cross has been repudiated by latter-day Saints, who instead mark their most sacred buildings with a statue of Moroni. Arguably the most important artifact of Mormonism, the object on which its existence rests, is missing. We do not have the Golden Plates, and only a dozen men claimed having seen them (a servant woman who claimed Moroni showed her the plates was never taken seriously). Valuable because of their material, their age, and their content, the Golden Plates have been replaced by a mass-produced book valuable because of its content. additional artifacts key to the Book of Mormon’s translation, the Urim and Thummim, are also missing. other artifacts and aspects of Mormon material culture were lost or abandoned as the Saints migrated from place to place. In recent years, however, some of these historical edifices have been rebuilt. A temple was constructed on the site of the first Nauvoo Temple; its exterior matches the original, though the interior does not. Historic kirtland is a meticulous reconstruction of a community that includes a sawmill, a store, a schoolhouse, and an inn. And while some latter-day Saints retain and cherish family heirlooms and personal items so imbued with spiritual significance—peep stones, or handkerchiefs or canes blessed with the power to heal—that they become religious artifacts, such items are increasingly sequestered in museums. What do these missing, rebuilt, repudiated, or sequestered artifacts mean to a people profoundly interested in ocumenting and preserving their material culture? How is meaning created by these objects? How do we understand the various meanings when the objects we've created are damaged by moth or rust, stolen by thieves, or lost? How does meaning shift when those objects are replaced by something else—leatherbound and gilt-edged Books of Mormon replacing the Golden Plates, for instance, or a modern LDS temple built on the site of a much older and very different building? How do these treasures of heaven on earth help us understand both heaven and earth?",

A boston Brahmin, herbalist, and cultural feminist, Augusta abandoned her wealthy first husband and six of her children to marry Brigham Young in 1843. Her letters are replete with the details of their failing relationship. Separating Brigham the prophet from Brigham the man, Augusta found the man an uncouth, lower-class hypocrite who often unfairly chastised her, played his favorite wives against her, and on occasion even whipped her. Although she bitterly complalined, like singer Patsy Cline, the more he abused her, the more she vowed to winn back his heart. While they never divorced, Augusta did have Brigham seal her for eternity to Joseph Smith and later asked to be sealed to St. Paul and even Jesus Christ.",

      "Description": "In the 1960s-1970s, Jose Davila and John Brewer independently discovered and translated various Nephite and Jaredite writings in central Utah. Though they regarded themselves as scientists, Davila and Brewer modeled their enterprise on the Joseph Smith story and the LDS prophetic tradition and actively sought acceptance by Church authorities and Mormon academics. After some initial encouragement, their activity was gradually marginalized. It was partly by differentiating itself from men such as Davila and Brewer that Book of Mormon archaeology became the formal discipline it is today.",

Many of Mitt’s ancestors, such as Parley P. and Mary Wood Pratt, Archibald Newell Hill, Charles Henry and Eliza Christine Wilcken, Miles Park and Hannah Hood Hill Romney, and Helaman and Dora Wilcken Pratt, participated in this unique marriage system. Their life histories offer a revealing cross section of the Principle, showing what it meant to live in plurality in nineteenth-century Nauvoo, Utah, Arizona, and Mexico.",

From the equal Rights amendment through California’s Proposition 8, the LDS Church has played a crucial if episodic role in the country’s culture wars. As a voting bloc, Mormons have become an anchor of the GOP—the most Republican of any religious grouping. and ideologically, Mormon conceptions of the United States and its founding have helped imbue the Republican Party with a new restorationist political religion. As the Republicans prepare to nominate a Mormon as their presidential nominee, this lecture will examine this new restorationism in the context of national religious politics, showing how it epitomizes the arrival of the Mormon community in the political mainstream.",

In the past few decades, developmental psychology has clarified that a person’s grasp of polarities with regard to conceptual (including political) understandings moves in an invariable progression based on one’s rising developmental center of gravity.

But in the case of torture, although condemning inhumane treatment of others, the Church failed to join with other groups in any serious attempt to designate torture as outside the realm of moral behavior. Furthermore, many Mormons were among the leaders in our country who created torture methods and attempted to legalize the activity during the Bush Administration. The Church wants a stronger voice in the public square, but how can it reconcile this desire with the selective choices it makes as to which moral beliefs it will support?",

Augusta was Brigham’s second plural wife of some 55 total. A Boston Brahmin, herbalist, and cultural feminist, Augusta abandoned her wealthy first husband and six of her children to marry Brigham young in 1843. Her letters are a treasure trove, replete with the details of broader Mormon history as well as a failing and acrimonious marriage. Separating Brigham the prophet from Brigham the man, Augusta claimed he refused to reciprocate her love for him, often unfairly chastised her, played his favorite wives against her, and on occasion even whipped her. Although she complained bitterly, like singer Patsy Cline, the more he abused her, the more she vowed to win back his heart. While they never divorced, Augusta repeatedly requested to be sealed for eternity to scores of different men, including Jesus Christ. Brigham did finally cancel their eternal sealing and had her sealed to Joseph Smith in 1848.",

The first question I’m typically asked by Mormons who discover I used to believe and no longer do is, “Why did you leave?” I’ve never found an answer that satisfied most true-believing Mormons.

But when some Saints lose their faith in the historicity of the Book of Mormon, they feel compelled to abandon it as completely false. if we can read the Book of Mormon as a fictitious text—what Hume calls a romance—then we can embrace the truth we find in the text without being dissuaded by the perceived improbabilities and inconsistencies that shatter the faith of the either/or believer. Part II: I always thought of fairy tales as entertaining stories for children. But having recently read many different fairy tales, I discovered that they speak profoundly to me (which may confirm that I have entered second childhood). Furthermore, I think they reveal truths that, by right of doctrine, and by public assertion, all Latter-day Saints confess they seek. In this presentation, I suggest there is something of the fairy tale in every religious denomination’s preferred story, with a particular focus on the LDS Church. I hope to show that fairy tales have more to say about life’s journey, spiritual and secular, than many of the cherished stories heard at church.",

      "Description": "The recent shakeup at BYU’s Maxwell Institute sent ripples throughout the Bloggernacle and raised questions about what the changes mean to groups such as FARMS, FAIR, and to Mormon apologetics in a larger context. What is the role of apologetics in general—both in and beyond Mormonism? Do Mormon apologists use similar stances or tactics as non-Mormon apologists? Who are some good, effective apologists and what can we—and Mormon Studies in general— learn from their approaches? What might emerge from a “new direction” for the Maxwell Institute and its publications? Would it help or hinder the Church as an organization to outsource apologetics and encourage FAIR to pick up where MI is apparently leaving off?",

Personal problems are often rooted in political, economic, cultural, and religious systems. Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants warns us that even divinely ordained power can be abused. This panel will look at power structures and relationships in the LDS Church. How does the structure of power influence the ways in which women and men use and experience power in the Church? By focusing on the abuse of power, we hope to shed light on both the structure and righteous use of power.",

How he used this authority reveals much about the man. His sermons during his brief reign as both God’s representative and United States’ regent reveal how tempting the use of church and state power becomes once consolidated. His “Telestial Kingdom” reflected excesses not only of rhetoric, but also of conduct. This paper will explore this period as a challenge to conceptualizing how a “king’s rule” is unsuited to the American republic and will include cautions from the Book of Mormon against attempting this very thing.",

Therefore, there must be some method available in Mormon belief and practice for communicating with God the Mother; perhaps writing letters is an acceptable means? In this session, participants will read short prepared letters (three to four minutes) to God the Mother as a way of talking to and about her. An LDS feminist theologian will offer an invocation at its beginning and bless it at its conclusion.

It was also illegal, often secret, and publicly denied by Church leaders, frequently forcing people in polygamous marriages into exile in Mexico and elsewhere. Many Romney ancestors, including Parley P. and Mary Wood Pratt, Archibald Newell Hill, Charles Henry and Eliza Christine Wilcken, Miles Park and Hannah Hood Hill Romney, and Helaman and Dora Wilcken Pratt, practiced polygamy.

      "Description": "On 27 June 1844, Joseph Smith was assassinated, leaving behind several claimants to leadership with no clear process for selecting a successor. Using archival data, we reconstruct the complex network of relations that existed among 76 members of the early LDS Church hierarchy. This includes a mapping of formal ties within and between priesthood quorums as well as family and marriage ties. Drawing on Burt’s theory of structural holes and other formal methods of social network analysis, we examine the underlying structural factors that contributed to the resolution of the succession crisis. While Brigham Young was only one of several potential successors, our analysis uses formal models to evaluate his ability to gain control of the structure, eliminate contenders by restructuring the formal and informal network of relations to his advantage, and eventually to emerge as the new prophet and president of the Church.",

Jolley will discuss the failure of Lobdell’s faith and respond to the questions—both stated and implied—that the book asks not only of Dr. Jolley, but of all Mormons.",

      "Presenters": "Glenn Cornett, Kim McCall",
      "Description": "In an April 1989 General Conference talk, Ezra Taft Benson said, “Pride is the great stumbling block to Zion.” This presenter agrees. An unquestioned, aggressively supported faith tends to dismiss logical argument and evidentiary consideration, thereby involving the abdication of one’s responsibility as a thoughtful moral agent. This is a form of pride that continues to be highly destructive in many forms outside of religion, including those of persistent tribalism and ideological extremism. This paper discusses unflinching, uncritical faith as a sin of pride, one that is indeed a stumbling block to the LDS community.",

      "Description": "Mormon feminists sense that the current “Mormon Moment” offers a good time for activism that draws attention to LDS women’s issues on a large scale. But what kind of act could match the significance of this “Mormon Moment”? Many feminists, myself included, have long argued that priesthood is the central issue for women in the Church because no significant changes can happen for women as long as an all-male priesthood controls all resources, discourses, and institutional power. Is it time to follow the example of Catholic “womenpriests” who claim to have been ordained privately by a bishop in good standing, beginning in 2002, even though the Vatican subsequently excommunicated the priests and womenpriests involved? This paper will explore the practical challenges if such a movement were to emerge among LDS women, as well as the theological and spiritual underpinnings for the idea in Mormon practice and doctrine.",

This session looks at a selection of these cartoons and considers their role in presenting Romney as a candidate, with special emphasis on his identification with Mormonism.

      "Description": "On 11 May 1970, Ernest L. Wilkinson stated, “There is certainly a spirit of unrest throughout the country and while it is manifest only slightly at the BYU it is nevertheless manifested here.” Student political activism at BYU during the late 1960s to early 1970s was, like student activism elsewhere, as much a function of the school’s prevailing culture as of activist trends nationally. BYU students across the political spectrum responded to local and national events in ways both informed by and in reaction to political and intellectual currents on the Utah Valley campus. Thus any discussion of BYU student activism must also examine the political climate at this LDS school. Such an examination locates BYU activism as occurring at an institution already politicized by an outspoken president, a mostly— but not entirely—sympathetic Board of Trustees, and a faculty and student body espousing somewhat broader political interests.",

The history of the burials and memorializations of Emma and her second husband, Lewis Bidamon, are central to the paper’s analysis. Utilizing archival sources and ethnographic fieldwork, the paper investigates the ways by which the memorials to Joseph and Emma mediate Mormons’ attention to and knowledge of the history of plural marriage.",

The Deep West is conceived of as the adjacent heartlands of the Colorado Rockies and plateau in Eastern Utah, Western Colorado, Northern Arizona, and New Mexico, along with the area’s deeper native and cultural bedrock. We’ll begin by mapping its five urban/geologic edges and fifteen inner “corners,” then explore the nine cultural archetypes/forces that characterize Deep Western conflicts/geopolitics, including the native, colonizer, operator, trader, agent, and stockman. Finally, we’ll use this framework to illuminate exemplary archetypal clashes in four Deep West corners.",

All cultures and families create this dynamic, which is not necessarily good or bad, but is still decidedly real. When the resulting behaviors and reactions are problematic, contradictory, or self-destructive, it is often because they are based on “thinking errors.” Cognitive behavioral therapy helps identify “thinking errors” as well as some of the forces that helped produce them.

      "Presenters": "Philip Barlow, Matthew Bowman, Robert A. Rees",
      "Description": "Part I: Widespread Mormon understanding holds that America—the United States in particular—is populated by a chosen people, governed by an inspired constitution, and possessor of a singular destiny. This belief has drawn attention outside Mormon ranks in light of Mitt Romney’s candidacy for the presidency: Would Mormon notions color a president Romney’s foreign policy? The role the US plays in Mormon thought and culture, however, is more complex than it first appears. Understanding this evolving role requires pairing “American exceptionalism” with “religious exceptionalism” as they function in the Mormon mind. In each of these spheres, there inheres an originally dominant exceptionalist gene and a contrasting recessive gene that challenges exceptionalist assurance. For instance, as Hebrew prophets reminded ancient Israel, “chosenness” may imply “selected for a role” rather than “superior.” Moreover, the proportional influence of these genes has shifted over time; the influence of the recessive genes is now stronger. All this means that exceptionalism, while common in Mormon culture, manifests in ways that are strong, mild, absent, or even inverted in individual Latter-day Saints. Part II: How did Mormons enter the twentieth century? How did the frontier church of Brigham Young become the polished, all-American faith of contemporary America? This presentation will explore the transformation of Mormonism in the early twentieth century, arguing that Mormonism found a place for itself in American life by recognizing in itself the ideals of the classic American progressive movement: optimism about humanity’s future, confidence in human potential, and faith in the power of organization to accomplish the fullest possibilities of what human society might become.",

Panel and audience members will then consider important questions: How should parents react when a doubting teenager announces he cannot go on a mission? How can a family support an emerging Borderlander through the trauma and heartbreak of the experience? What should we do with a family member we suspect is in the Borderlands but pretends otherwise? If you are in the Borderlands, closeted or not, what can you do to preserve family unity?",

This essay will examine the historical record for clues that can help us determine more “precisely why, how, or when this restriction began” and will look at a group of interracial marriages in the 1840s that appear to have influenced early Church leaders’ thoughts on the propriety of such relationships.",

Many Mormons maintain that the accounts of the vision are historically accurate, while critics assert that different accounts are inconsistent and historically inaccurate. This session will summarize the various accounts and give an overview of the evidence for and against the historicity of various parts of the vision, including a summary of eight criteria for assessing historical authenticity. After hearing this summary of evidence, the session audience will vote on the historicity of each major section of the vision. The session will conclude with a tabulation of the voting results by the audience.",

      "Presenters": "Brian C. Hales, Lorie Winder, Todd Compton",
      "Description": "Part I: Of Joseph Smith’s 34 plural wives, 13 had legal husbands at the time they were sealed to him. Since Fawn Brodie’s 1945 No Man Knows My History, virtually every author who has written about Nauvoo plural marriages has concluded that the prophet practiced sexual polyandry (or at least may have) with some or all of these women. However, since the beginning of the Church, polyandrous sexuality has been consistently condemned by Church leaders—after all, women today cannot be sealed to more than one man at a time. So what was going on? Did Joseph Smith practice sexual polyandry? If so, was it in accordance with his teachings or contradictory to them? This session will examine the evidence. Part II: That a number of Mormon plural wives were imprisoned during the late nineteenth century and became the focus of intense public controversy has been relegated to little more than a footnote in Latter-day Saint histories. Their cases merit attention because they occupy an often precedent- setting place in the history of the antipolygamy legislative and judicial crusades and have significant revelatory value as barometers of public sentiment. Further, they invite us to consider the problem of plural wives as agents within a patriarchal religious tradition and the competing narratives that often portray them as either heroic and autonomous or abused and victimized.",

      "Description": "Shortly after Willard Richards arrived in Nauvoo from England in August 1841, he became Joseph Smith’s closest confidant, assuming a role once enjoyed by John C. Bennett. Bennett’s departure from Mormonism was not quiet, and as he toured the country exposing and sensationalizing Mormon secrets, including polygamy, Richards followed doing damage control. Yet Richards was a polygamy insider introduced to the practice by Joseph Smith. He had performed one of Smith’s plural marriages and may have begun practicing it himself while his first wife, Jennetta, endured a lonely year in Massachusetts where he’d left her while he settled in Nauvoo. This paper examines Richards’s role as a polygamy insider, confidant, and public relations man during the tumultuous period of 1841-1842.",

Most missionaries understand the difficulties, pressure to perform, mission politics, boredom, depression, emotional demands, and physical hardships of a mission. However, there is an unwritten rule never to speak negatively about one’s mission. Consequently, homecomings are typically uplifting pep talks, and candid discussion of one’s mission often provokes hostility. This session will explore the explicit and implicit pressure to spin missions positively and how this affects people, as well as offer ideas about how to acknowledge unpleasant reality in a culture that frowns on bluntness.",

IPP is not an improved way to practice Mormonism, but a series of practices to help one deepen in awareness, become more integrated, grow to higher levels of human development, and embrace the world virtuously. This session explains how correlations between IPP and the mystical practices of many traditions demonstrate that the Restored Gospel includes the wisdom of the East—more than any other Western traditions.",

The most fundamental way to participate in the political process is to register to vote and go to the polls. In the LDS Church, leaders are expected to set an example. This presentation will examine the level of political involvement and general voting habits of LDS general authorities, stake presidents, and bishops in central Utah.",

And, being a multi-billion-dollar operation, it has the resources to convince people through organizations such as the More Good Foundation, Mormon Voices (a.k.a. the Mormon defense League), and the Washington Post column of Church PR managing director Michael Otterson. The irony is that the Church has no hesitation about making up all sorts of inaccurate (and often insulting) claims about what ex-Mormons—“apostates”— are like. We may not have as much money or political clout as the LDS Church, but using tools such as the Internet, we can take ownership of our own narratives and claim our place in the public discourse on Mormonism.",

His voice then shifts from critic to apologist as he explains why he still believes in many Mormon teachings while rejecting certain elements of corporate Mormonism. In doing so, he explores the roles of proof, preference, facts, faith, history, myth, reason, intuition, imagination, and spiritual encounters in human existence, and discloses some surprising close encounters from his own life.",

      "Description": "Empathy is the ability to understand and, on a deeply caring level, respond to the needs of other creatures. Alma speaks of followers of Christ as those who are “willing to bear one another’s burdens, . . . mourn with those that mourn, . . . and comfort those that stand in need of comfort.” And yet there seems to be a paucity of empathy in modern society, including among Christians (and, therefore, Mormons). This panel explores the nature and various dimensions of these virtues, their biological and spiritual roots, their strengths and insufficiencies in a hierarchical contest with love for a global universal value, and the degree to which they are manifest or lacking in Mormon religious practice.",

      "Description": "LDS missions have long been recognized as a rite of passage for young Mormon men, yet young women can and often do serve as full-time missionaries. Some sister missionaries report that their mission experiences were positive and stimulating, while others find that missions marginalize women and can carry a lifelong stigma. General Conference talks, the structure of mission hierarchy, and snide remarks by Mormon men to sister missionaries all reinforce the idea that women are not wanted in the mission field. This panel will discuss the experiences of sister missionaries, talk about how the mission experience can be both empowering and alienating for women, and explore why LDS men are often so proprietary about this unique Mormon experience.",

      "Presenters": "Christopher Smith, Joe Geisner, D. Michael Quinn",
      "Description": "Part I: In 1908 and 1909, B.H. Roberts learned that some high-level LDS leaders continued to sanction secret polygamous marriages despite the two Manifestos forbidding the practice. Roberts compared this situation to president Smith’s “whisper campaign” supporting the Republican Party in violation of the Church’s policy of political neutrality. At the October 1909 General Conference, Roberts denounced such double-dealing as a stain on the Church’s honor and pleaded for integrity and consistency in Church marriage policy. But what Roberts, a polygamist and Democrat, seems to have really wanted was for the Church to drop the pretense of monogamy and political neutrality altogether and to openly endorse polygamy and the Democrats. Roberts’s conference talk doubles as a critique of both the secret violation of the polygamy ban and of the ban itself. Both represented a breach of faithfulness to the laws of God and the Church. Part II: This paper will explore the life and legacy of B.H. Roberts and his Mormon faith. The publication of B.H. Roberts’s Studies in the Book of Mormon in 1985 led many to conclude that at the end of his life, Roberts had lost his faith in the Book of Mormon as an ancient record. one must therefore ask, “Why did Roberts not leave Mormonism?” This paper will demonstrate that even after this crisis of faith, Roberts remained Mormon through and through.",

While many people accepted the buildings without question, others found them unattractive. An evaluation 40 years after their dedication will explore the origin of the Ogden/Provo temple designs. The designs reflect an attempt to create a modern, efficient temple in the stylistic vocabulary of the time and represent the apex of Modernism in temple design. The two temples set a benchmark for efficiency and reflect an era of optimism about what Mormonism could achieve. Forty years later, the status of the two temples indicates a further shift in the Mormon concept of temples.",

This seminar will discuss the background behind Transitions, a new video and workbook resource designed for immigrants shifting from Mormonism to more traditional forms of Christianity. It will consider the perspective and needs of the transitioner, the multidisciplinary perspectives and resources that inform Transitions, and how religious institutions might better assist those making the journey from one religious tradition to another.",

      "Presenters": "Cheryl Bruno, Joe Swick",
      "Description": "During sweeping social change of the 1820s, Americans became increasingly disenchanted with Freemasonry as a kind of secular priesthood. The William Morgan affair (1826) led to an anti-Masonic movement fueled by fears that a free society could not thrive in the presence of secret organizations. Anti-masons argued that masons formed a secret combination bound by secret rituals which contained immoral oaths; Masons secretly colluded outside the established boundaries of the political process, yet acted politically as a group; and that individual members were above the law. Most troubling, Freemasonry seemed to blur the line between the religious and the secular. Mormonism is one of the last great flowerings inspired by pre-Morgan style American Freemasonry, and it is significant that similar concerns came to be expressed regarding presidential candidate Joseph Smith and the incipient Mormon kingdom. Following Masonic models in organizations such as the Danite Band, the Relief Society, the Council of Fifty, this theocratic kingdom struck fear in the hearts of many, both in and out of the Church.",

      "Description": "Controversies over unpopular religious practices and intolerance toward minority religions are older than the document that protects them. What is and is not protected under the First Amendment? The question has been asked often throughout our nation’s history, each time with the blinding spotlight of public scrutiny shining on a different minority religious group—including, of course, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Though the role of scrutinized/persecuted minority religious group has not been an easy or particularly pleasant one for Mormons to play, their struggles have contributed to a valuable service for all Americans, religious and nonreligious alike. The Mormon experience of pushing for political, cultural, and social acceptance has helped to shape our understanding—and expand our appreciation—of both the “free exercise” and “establishment” clauses of the First Amendment. From polygamy to the 2012 presidential race, the experience of LDS Americans—politicians, prisoners, and proselytizers alike—has mirrored that of other minority religious groups pushing to both live out their faith and live fully as part of the patchwork of our nation: Native Americans using peyote as part of religious ceremonies; Jehovah’s Witnesses abstaining from saying the Pledge of Allegiance; Muslim students wearing headscarves to public school; and Catholics rejecting evangelical Christian drug rehabilitation programs that contradict their own faith—just to name a few! Join us to hear Eunice Rho of the American Civil Liberties Union explore how Mormons and other religious minority groups have helped to strengthen religious liberty in the United States by demanding that the government fully “enforce” the religion clauses of the First Amendment. Ms. Rho will also discuss how ongoing religious discrimination against different groups in different parts of the country continues to keep the ACLU very busy in defense of religious liberty.",

      "Presenters": "Donald Westbrook",
      "Description": "LDS temples are enigmatic and problematic for non-Mormons, especially for non-Mormon scholars of Mormonism. Most information about temples—their history, use, theological significance, sociological and psychological importance—is readily available from Mormon Studies scholars and even the church itself, and temples are open for public tours before dedication. On the other hand, aspects of temple ceremonies, in particular the endowment, are not released to the public, or even to Mormons who are not temple worthy. Temple-worthy participants take vows not to reveal such elements, and they have been traditionally understood as “sacred not secret”—even if Mormons functionally understand them as both, and some outsiders disrespectfully consider them neither. This presentation explores the problematics of researching LDS temples for the non-Mormon scholar of Mormonism, and in particular seeks to answer two questions: for non-Mormons such as myself who respect sacred space, what methodological difficulties arise? Are there times when a religious tradition’s sense of the sacred is off-limits for full scholarly investigation, and if so, when and why? Relevant parallels from the Church of Scientology—another American-born religious tradition that engenders similar questions and challenges to outsiders—will be considered for context.",

      "Description": "Many Biblical and non-Biblical sources discuss ancient ascensions into the presence of God.  One source for such ascensions, which is often neglected by Latter-day Saints and others, is the Book of Mormon.  This paper will discuss the ancient concepts of ascension and theophany, and how the Book of Mormon has as a major underlying theme man’s effort to return back into God’s presence.  Ascension themes in the Book of Mormon will be compared and contrasted to those in other ancient texts, including Revelation, Ascension of Isaiah, and other ancient literature.",

      "Description": "Joseph Smith remains a “character” in the American national historical discussion. Objectivity about “how to study Joseph Smith” is a growing field of research and focus. This paper focuses on the application of both contemporary business and traditional psychological communication models to the “personality” of Joseph Smith. Principally, the presentation will provide a road map for getting past the  “Persecution Perceptions” that many (if not most) of the Joseph Smith scholars grapple with. Piercing the Paradigm of Persecution when it is part of one’s DNA is extremely difficult…and that need compellingly still exists in the constantly expanding field of Joseph Smith scholarship. Emotionally mature discussions of business behavior often fall into the simple 4-factor models dating from the Greeks. These models are reduced to the Four Key Questions of Behavior: Why? What? How? And Who? This paper will apply those dimensions to the emerging Joseph Smith Papers Persona of Joseph Smith and invite discussion of a simpler, more objective treatment of the apparent  contradictions in the evolving “picture” of Joseph Smith.",

This panel invites a second, and third, and fourth look at the issue. What is at stake in the historicity question? In what different ways do people negotiate those stakes?",

Today, we bring together four women from patriarchal religions to explore what happens when religious feminists call an all-male priesthood into question and examine the theological and cultural assumptions upon which an all-male priesthood rests. How can we help each other in advocating for ordination and expanded roles for women? Being aware of each other’s faith and concerns, becoming versed in each other’s prior activism, and working together can help swing the pendulum toward equality in both traditions.",

      "Description": "Dr. Sara Patterson will explore the shifting gender expectations for med during the transition from a polygamous to a monogamous system. Examining how gender expectations were created and reinforced, she will investigate how sexual roles were and are tied to gender and religious beliefs in Mormonism. As she does so she will compare the gender expectations for Mormom men to those for Protestand men during the same period. Patterson will argue that Mormons fashioned a masculinity that would distinguish them from other Americans will at the same time claim a stake in American identity.",

      "Description": "Shortly after Willard Richards arrived in Nauvoo for the first time in August 1841, he became Joseph Smith's closest confidant, assuming a role once enjoyed by John C. Bennett. Bennett's departure from Nauvoo and Mormonism was not a quiet one, and as he toured the country exposing and sensationalizing Mormon secrets (most notably, polygamy) Richards followed him doing damage control. Yet Richards was a polygamy insider, who had been introduced to the practice by Joseph Smith, had performed one of Smith's plural marriages, and may have even begun practicing it himself - all while Richard's wide, Jenetta, endured a lonely year in Massachusetts where he'd left her while he got settled in Nauvoo. This paper will examine Richard's rold as a polygamy insider, confidant, and public relations man during the tumultous period of 1841-42.",

The failure of the Kirtland Safety Society Anti-Banking Society and the concern over Joseph Smith’s ecclesiastical leadership set the stage for serious dissent among the Quorum of Apostles at Kirtland.  Apostles Luke Johnson and John F. Boynton were excommunicated at Kirtland in late 1837. The following year, Apostles Lyman E. Johnson, William E. McLellin and Thomas B.
