		"Title": "Smith Pettit Lecture Jesus Christ Marriage And Mormon Christianities",
		"Presenters": "John G. Turner",
		"Description": "Marriage has divided Mormons and Christians, and marriage has contributed to divisions among not only Mormons but among many other Christian churches as well. Because marriage occupies such a central place in Mormon history and doctrine, though, changes in marital practices and debates about marriage have proved unusually fraught for Latter-day Saints. Indeed, from scholarly debate about Joseph Smith's marriages to the angst-filled discussions of same-sex relationships today, conflicts about marriage have torn families and institutions asunder. Certain ideas about marriage thrill some, while repelling others. For this outsider, certain moments in the history of Mormon marriage have repelled, while others have proven attractive. Those moments include the practice of plural marriage at the height of the 1856-1857 Mormon reformation, and also Mormon ritual reenactment of Mary's anointing of Jesus.\nConflicts over marriage have often caused individuals, churches, and families to forget the other things that bind them together. Doctrines, histories, and rituals connect \"many Mormonisms,\" just as they connect Mormonism and other branches of Christianity.\n",

		"Presenters": "Mica McGriggs, Russel Stevenson, Nancy Ross, Brad Kramer ",
		"Description": "Depicting ethnic diversity within Mormon art and scholarship often magnifies the religion’s white dominant membership. For example, J. Kirk Richards’ “Eve and the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge,” which depicts a nude black Eve, drew criticism for presenting an “exoticized” black woman “naked and up for auction.” Since depictions of black Mormons in history, sociology, and art are mostly produced by whites, this panel asks the question, \"To what extent is the black image in Mormonism affected by a white filter?\"",

		"Presenters": "Julie de Azevedo Hanks",
		"Description": "Mormonism has inherited ways of thinking that are no longer sufficient to understand or address the complexities facing the 21st century Church. Concepts from cybernetics, systems theory, and complex thought will be presented as alternative lenses with which to view and wrestle with the Church’s increased historical transparency, gender concerns, racial diversity, LGBTQIA issues, and member disaffection. It will be argued that movement toward a circular epistemology that promotes awareness of interconnections, allows for complexity, and encourages tolerance for ambiguity will infuse more compassion, hope, and inclusion into our communities and inspire more creative approaches to addressing our current challenges.",

God needs willing earthly hands to build Zion, it can’t be built by celestial beings alone.” –William H. Chamberlin\nChamberlin was one of the first Mormons to study philosophy and biblical criticism and was blacklisted from teaching for Church education. The statement that we could make Mormonism true references Mormonism’s doctrine that humans are divine, creative beings, and that the highest form of truth is activity toward the creation of an ethical, just, and loving world.",

For many, the unique shared values and norms of “Mormon culture” both interact with and transcend national, ethnic, and other identities. This has important implications for the way Mormons live their faith and deal with challenges to it. Using findings from cultural and social psychology along with a series of personal anecdotes, this presentation aims to shed some light on some of the psychological underpinnings of Mormon culture and what it takes to undergo or cause major change within such a framework.",

		"Description": "The “Sex/Porn Addiction” Model, developed in the 1980’s, has promoted therapy and treatment services that are based in arbitrary, moralistic and sex-negative messaging and that do not stand up to academic, evidence-based scrutiny. Proponents claim that individuals become addicted to sexual pleasure or to watching pornography in the same way someone may become chemically dependent to substances. This unfounded claim has spread like wildfire, especially in religiously conservative communities such as ours. Instead of approaching sexual variety as a healthy part of the human experience, this model leverages sexual shame and treats individuals with any unconventional sexual behavior as pathological. This has severe implications in regards to treatment modalities, self-identity, relational processes and an individual’s long-term relationship with their sexuality.",

		"Description": "“When saw we thee... naked, and clothed thee?” Some societies have clothed God as a fierce warrior, a regal king, a father, mother, a shepherd, a lamb, a primal hunter or agricultural being. Each of these clothings reflects a people's vision of the ideal being and offers ways to become more like that being. Julian of Norwich struggled for thirty-years to “re-clothe God” because her revelation of Christ did not match her Catholic version of him. We can learn much from her about how our visions of God can change as we grow “line upon line, precept upon precept.”",

Through it all, I am looking for the truth and the life. I am seeking again for the good news of the Gospel, or gospel, however big the “G” needs to be.",

Brigham Young felt at liberty to complete both as he imagined they ought to be completed. This presentation will discuss whether there was an \"original,” and what it did and did not include.",

In this paper, I demonstrate how members of the Church have designed and implemented the programs of the Church to deny and deflect their complicity in colonization and how Indigenous people can resist.",

While an ethnie may a precursor to a nation, they are not a perfect predictor. To develop into a nation an ethnie would have to master common economy, legal structures and reproduce a mass cultural identity. Mormonism demonstrates some of the key theoretical concepts that identify an ethnie: a mythomoteur, a golden-age, a territorial homeland, and a messianic mission. Mormonism, as a cultural ethnie, will be reviewed with emphasis on convergence and divergence with ethnosymbolist principles.",
