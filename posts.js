After some intense experiences with Fundamentalist church leadership and offers of plural wives, I ended up walking away from Mormonism entirely. I later studied Buddhism, the occult, and various other philosophies. My current philosophy is an amalgamation of all that I have learned; I do not believe that one&#8217;s allegiance needs to be given to a single path.",

In this session, “the Janas” will explain the basics of what the Enneagram is (no experience is necessary), focusing particularly on the ways Mormons and post-Mormons might use it as a tool for deepening spirituality and also navigating the institutional LDS Church. How might a 2 or a 3 have a natural advantage in Mormon culture, while a 4 or an 8 might have a harder time gaining acceptance? What resources might various types draw on to direct their spiritual journeys?",

Because Bob is certain that in spite of everything, there is hope and faith and—most of all—love.” \n",

            "Description": "Sexuality is a taboo topic both within the general population and Mormon culture, with sexual shame being a common factor among many of its members. This session gives attendants access to the expertise of one of Mormonism’s few AASECT certified sex therapists. Attendees can ask questions directly or anonymously in a safe space. Addressing sexuality openly is a healing component to the healthy sexual journeys we all deserve and crave.",

This idea will not seem so outlandish to Mormons, and once you accept it, many mysteries are resolved. For example, any extraterrestrial civilization would be inconceivably advanced, making them, potentially, far more interested in the morality of our choices than the shininess of our gadgets.",

There are countless Christian ministries that train on how to evangelize Latter-day Saints, organize protests at Mormons functions, publish tracts and books, etc.  Yet Christians lose to atheism at a nearly 5 to 1 ratio, despite near-zero effort from atheist organizations to single out Mormons. The reason why can be found in sociological data and ex-Mormon narratives. Though Mormons&#8217; first exposure to critical information about the Church often comes from Christian ministries, further inquiry leads them to atheism.",

Transfeminism attempts to address issues that arise from the intersection of sexism and cissexism. This standpoint critique involves two steps: (i) a critique of the dominant theological paradigm showing how it excludes the trans community and arises from the arbitrary biases of those in positions of power in the church, and (ii) a presentation of an alternative theological paradigm that starts from the position of trans women.\nIn order to illustrate how a transfeminist interpretation of Mormon theology can emerge from within the tradition, I will consider the documentary film directed by Torbern Bernhard entitled &#8220;Transmormon&#8221; that documents the coming out story of trans woman Eri Hayward, who also happens to be a Mormon from Utah.",

            "Description": "Just as the Civil Rights Act of 1968 did not end racism in the United States, so the lifting of the priesthood and temple ban for blacks of African descent in 1978 did not end racism in the LDS Church. Even with the Official Declaration in 2012 and the publication of “Race and Priesthood” in 2013, racism in the Mormon church and culture continues as a significant problem. While changes in policy have produced positive shifts, this paper argues that nothing short of a formal truth and reconciliation commission undertaken by the Church will resolve the complex social, religious, and spiritual issues surrounding the priesthood and temple ban.",

You have a good religion, but you need to own it. Most of its members are borrowing it.” Many—perhaps most—church members treat membership as if it were a stamp on their passport, something potentially useful but largely consigned to sit on the shelf. While ownership of one’s religion is not a new concept, the Internet—which has democratized data and thus confronted often-unwitting church members with “inconvenient truth”—presents constant challenges to the faith of those who have failed to dig deeper—to “own” their religion. To own Mormonism, you must own its history, own its doctrine, own its reality, and own personal responsibility.",

My paper is divided into two sections addressing at least four pieces of important historical evidence that show that women were ordained as priestesses to God in Nauvoo; I will then employ mythic patterns to disclose the hidden presence of the Goddess in the temple endowment ceremony.",
